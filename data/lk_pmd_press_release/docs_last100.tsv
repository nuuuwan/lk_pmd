The President further stated that a series of development programmes, including the establishment of industrial zones, will soon be implemented to create new economic opportunities in the North.', 'He also stressed that the government is dedicated to safeguarding the land rights, linguistic rights and cultural rights of the people in the North, while ensuring their right to know about the missing persons. The President affirmed that the government’s goal is to build national unity within the country and that the necessary decisions and measures will be taken without hesitation to achieve this.', 'President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made these remarks today (2) while attending the inauguration ceremony of the Northern Coconut Triangle in Puthukkudiyiruppu, coinciding with the World Coconut Day celebrations held under the theme “Ratama Saru Karai Nirathuru – Kapthuru Saviya.”', 'Based on recommendations from the Coconut Research Institute, the Northern Coconut Triangle has been established, covering the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya, by linking the towns of Point Pedro, Silawathura and Kokkilai. Under this initiative, Rs. 500 million was allocated from the previous budget to provide high-yield coconut saplings to cultivators in the North and to develop 16,000 acres of new coconut plantations in 2025.\nOver the three years from 2025 to 2027, the cultivated extent is expected to increase to 40,000 acres. This is aimed at establishing a thriving coconut industry in the Northern Province, uplifting the livelihoods of its people and raising export earnings from coconut-related products by an additional USD 70 million annually.', 'On this occasion, the President also presented ownership deeds for government assistance to farmers engaged in coconut cultivation across the five districts of the Northern Province.\nThe commemorative magazine prepared for the 2025 World Coconut Day celebrations was officially presented to the President.', 'Furthermore, Deputy Director General of the International Coconut Community, Mr Nuwan Chinthaka, presented to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake the certificate of recognition awarded to Sri Lanka by the International Coconut Community.', 'Addressing the ceremony, President Dissanayake said;', 'We know that the Puthukkudiyiruppu area has in the past been one of the regions most severely affected by conflict. As a result of those battles, the people here lost everything. During the last election, I had the opportunity to meet with the people of this region. It is clear that both the area and its people need to be rejuvenated. In particular, during the last election, the people living in these areas placed their trust in us and took a significant step forward. It is our expectation to carry that trust forward towards success.', 'To achieve this, we have already begun work in several areas. Firstly, we must ensure the rights of these people. We recognise land rights, language rights, cultural rights and the right to know about their missing loved ones, as their fundamental rights. We have therefore launched a series of measures to safeguard these rights.', 'Secondly, we must strengthen their economy. As a government, we take responsibility for restoring the economic opportunities they lost and creating a robust economy for them. For this too, we have already taken a number of steps.', 'Among them are the establishments of new industrial zones in the North, the development of tourism as a sector with fresh potential, the provision of essential facilities such as water for agriculture and as a central initiative, the coconut cultivation project launched today.\nUnder this programme, the Ministry has planned to cultivate 16,000 acres of coconut this year, involving nearly 12,000 farming families. We believe this project will become a strong foundation for uplifting the economy of these people.', 'Equally important is the unity we must build among ourselves at a cultural level. To this end, we have named a day that can be celebrated by all together. We are also working to strengthen interrelations through sport. We are engaged in a significant effort to reunite people who have long been divided.', 'For decades, the lives of those here were overshadowed by war. Distrust, suspicion and weapons defined a 30-year-long conflict. That was a great tragedy for our country. It divided our people and gave rise to communal politics.', 'Both in the North and the South, communalism became the main tool for gaining power. Yet, during the last Presidential Election, the people of this country defeated that trend. We will not allow communal politics to resurface in this country again. Likewise, I believe that you, too, as citizens, must reject such politics.', 'Our government’s goal is to create unity. We will not hesitate to take any decision necessary to achieve this, even if it may seem difficult. Nor will we allow the regressive, destructive slogans of the past to obstruct the progressive measures we are now taking.', 'The people of these areas continue to suffer from severe economic hardships. Step by step, we are working to provide solutions to these challenges. Over the past year, we have laid the foundation for this essential work. Today, the political authority has been cleansed of corruption and fraud. We are working to strengthen the public service, to re-establish the rule of law and to increase state revenue. Our aim is to build a strong economy that will enable us to repay our debts.', 'We are also restarting stalled development projects, as well as launching many new ones. In every sector, we have initiated fresh development. In this way, we have laid the foundation for transforming this country into a new state. Upon this foundation, we will rebuild Sri Lanka, making it once more a nation respected and admired by the world. On this journey, we seek the support of all of you.

Although symbolically it was the issuance of an immigration document, our intervention in this task had a much broader purpose. Our entire administrative structure has been centred in Colombo, compelling people living in distant provinces to travel to Colombo for many services.', 'The aim of our government is to decentralise this administration to even the most remote rural villages. Facilities must be arranged so that citizens can access government services close to them. By next year, our objective is to enable people to carry out all their transactions with the government through computer software systems and even from their mobile phones. The foremost priority of our government is digitalisation.', 'At the same time, steps have been taken to strengthen the public service. At the District Committee meeting held at this very place earlier, I announced that we would be granting a salary increase in April. We have done so. By next January, we will ensure that the remaining portion of that increase is also provided. If this country is to be rebuilt, a strong public service is essential. Every developed nation has a robust public service and we too are working to build one in our country.”', 'Your signature carries great responsibility. If you use it to serve the people, we will give you our fullest protection. But if you use it for financial gain, the law will take its course. We need a State that upholds the rule of law. Unfortunately, our country has become a place where the law has been disregarded and the dignity of public institutions has collapsed. We must restore respect to every state institution and ensure that every public officer regains the honour they deserve. To support this, we will provide the necessary facilities to state institutions.', 'Our country has reached a point where we must rebuild from the ground up. We have a comprehensive development plan for the Northern Province. For the first time, at the last Presidential and General Elections, the people of the North entrusted their votes to form a government. In a country once divided and mistrustful, people placed confidence in governance. Our duty now is to ensure that this unity is not broken but strengthened, building a nation of togetherness and brotherhood for future generations.', 'We are aware that certain defeated political forces are attempting to use nationalism as a tool to regain power. This can be seen both in the North and the South. But such nationalist politics serve politicians, not the people. Therefore, all of us whether in the North or the South must reject nationalist politics and ensure it never rises again. We are firmly committed to this.', 'As a government, we strongly believe there will never be another war in our country. Some try to spread fear that war will return. But our work is to ensure it does not. We must return people’s lands to them, reopen closed roads and eliminate suspicion between communities. I am confident that all of us will work to prevent another war and with that mind-set, we must move our country forward. We must build a new society, leaving behind failed political movements, religious divisions and casteism these belong to the past. Today, what matters is not ethnicity, religion or caste, but humanity. We must place humanity above all divisions and build a country where humanity is the highest value. That is the future of both our country and the world.', 'I am aware that when we excavate the earth, old skeletons surface. Today, the discovery of mass graves in Chemmani has caused great concern. We are conducting a fully transparent investigation into these. Our goal is to ensure that such mass graves will never be created again in this country.', 'At this moment, we are fulfilling the most important needs of our nation.

He further stated that a programme will be launched through the youth movement to transform young men and women into leaders and stakeholders in the country’s development path.', 'President Dissanayake made these remarks this morning (12) addressing the “Youth Club” National Youth Conference held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo.', 'The President highlighted that the future generation should be one that represents Sri Lanka proudly on the global stage and is guided by empathy towards others. He stressed that the government is committed to creating such a qualified generation to take over the country’s future, while calling upon all youth across the nation to strive to become those capable leaders.', 'This year’s National Youth Conference was notable for being held after a lapse of 32 years, with the participation of over 6,000 young men and women from across the island. In the lead-up to the conference, “Youth Clubs” were established at the regional level throughout the country and during today’s national gathering, the newly appointed officers were officially introduced.', 'In conjunction with his participation in the National Youth Conference, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was also presented with a commemorative gift.', 'Addressing the Conference, President Dissanayake further stated:', '“I believe this is the most-discussed and most-anticipated youth conference in recent times. Generally, in our country, many sectors have been driven by the desire for political power. Within the youth movement, there has never truly been an opportunity for individuals to progress based on their own talents and aspirations.', 'When you visited the districts, who were given precedence in taking on political leadership or leading other institutions in your district? Priority was given to the daughters, sons or relatives of the old political leadership. As a result, the youth movement was largely aligned with the political ambitions of those in power. For a long time, this youth movement was developed as a tool to protect their own political influence, maintain family power and keep leadership within their kinship networks.', 'However, with the new political transformation in the country, this youth movement has evolved beyond being merely a pawn of political ambitions. It has transformed into a movement that nurtures leaders who will take responsibility for the country’s future. This transformation has been clearly reflected throughout our journey up to this National Youth Conference.', 'It’s no surprise that some feel uneasy. Today, what we are truly doing is empowering our youth by giving them their rightful place and helping build a responsible young leadership that understands how their future should be shaped and what duties they must bear. This is not about creating mere tools to maintain family dynasties or political power for extended periods. There’s talk that the future of the country lies in the hands of its youth. But our true ambition is to make you the real custodians of that future, those who genuinely hold the responsibility for our nation’s path forward.', 'Specifically, there is one point we want to make clear to you here. Today, we hold positions such as the Presidency, Ministerial offices and Parliamentary seats. However, even as we occupy these roles, we do so with the firm understanding that there will come a day when we will step aside. We have no intention of clinging to these positions indefinitely. We have a very clear and sincere intention. This country was once under the control of a highly destructive group. We have taken over political power from that group. The power we now hold, we do so with the expectation that, in due course, we will pass the baton to you, the next generation. We do not wish to stay in these roles for an extended duration.', 'Therefore, we must nurture a new generation of young leaders who possess the ability, competence, integrity and conscience to take responsibility for the country. We need to prepare a generation ready to inherit this nation after us. What kind of generation do we need? In today’s fast-paced world, knowledge is rapidly produced, developed and disseminated. Looking back at history, great leaps in knowledge were achieved over long periods of time. However, today, the knowledge we already possess is rapidly generating new knowledge at an unprecedented pace. Moreover, this new knowledge is growing and spreading quickly. The future of the country must not be entrusted to a generation of youth who are unprepared to grasp and harness these vast and rapidly expanding realms of knowledge.', 'Therefore, our aspiration is to create a new generation for the youth movement, one that rapidly adjusts the fast-growing knowledge of the modern world and quickly adapts to it. We stand firm in the belief that the future of our country must be entrusted to this new generation. Furthermore, compassion and empathy must be inherent within us.', 'Currently, our education system and way of life have confined our youth within a self-centred shell. Within such a group, genuine empathy towards society is lacking. This is why we need a young generation that truly cares for the broader community. Self-centeredness has frozen and destroyed many valuable qualities in our society, extinguishing much of what is good.', 'To lead our country forward and achieve meaningful social development, it is essential to build a society rooted in genuine empathy. In this endeavour, the youth movement has been entrusted with a significant role. I firmly believe that you must become citizens who embody empathy and compassion.', 'Similarly, the innate desire for justice and fairness among the youth must be rejuvenated. Wherever injustice exists, there should be a courageous voice to speak up for justice. For such a voice to be genuine and not merely superficial, one must first become a person who truly values justice and acts with fairness. Unfortunately, a significant portion of our society today is driven by deception, many speak about justice and strive to appear as champions of fairness, but we must honestly reflect on how deeply justice and fairness are actually embraced in their actions.', 'Raising a voice for justice alone does not transform someone into a just and principled individual. The primary measure of becoming a just citizen lies in how sincerely one upholds justice and acts fairly. Therefore, before you raise your voice for justice and stand for fairness, become a young person with a genuine conscience who truly embodies justice and fairness. We are not entrusting this country to a mere crowd, rather, we are handing over the future of the nation to a new generation that is closely connected to the world and possesses empathy for society. Hence, our mission is to build a youth movement qualified to take responsibility for this country’s future. I urge you to become that qualified young generation.', 'Today, an issue regarding employment has arisen. Recently, I visited the Maldives, where nearly 30,000 of our young men and women are engaged in jobs. However, these are not government positions. The government there has developed a distinct economy externally. Yet, we have long failed to build an economy that generates employment for skilled and capable people in the informal sector. As a result of this failure, the state itself has become an institution that merely provides jobs. It must not be forgotten that a government should be an institution that creates employment, not just one that supplies jobs.', 'We all know that the 20th century witnessed major transformations worldwide. Before that century, scientists predicted that states equipped with advanced technology would emerge. Politicians and scholars envisioned the creation of a political world quite different from before, one governed not by monarchies or ruling elites but by governments elected by the people. Similarly, economic experts foresaw the development of new global economic conditions. In this way, what we mostly encountered during the 17th and 18th centuries were only speculative ideas about the future world. These speculations became a reality only in the 20th century.', 'Due to transformations in technology, science, the marketplace and people’s lifestyles, a vast global market has emerged. However, we have become a nation that has failed to fully grasp and benefit from this market. As a result, an informal economy has not been developed and the government has become the sole institution providing employment.', 'We need to modernize a government that has become largely stagnant. To this end, Cabinet approval has been granted to recruit nearly 62,000 people into the public service. However, the employment issue cannot be solved merely by this. We must create an open economy through government processes that generates employment opportunities. Plans have already been prepared toward this goal.', 'We expect that 2.5 million tourists will visit our country this year, and by 2030, this number is anticipated to grow to 4 million. Along with this growth, an economy based on the tourism industry will be established in the open market, and this economy will generate employment opportunities.', 'We also anticipate that by 2030, the digital economy will grow to reach US $ 15 billion. Our goal is for the digital economy to contribute 12% of the country’s national output. Additionally, we expect a significant transformation through the digitization of agriculture, fisheries and small and medium-scale industries. To achieve this, we need a young generation equipped with knowledge and skills in information technology. This will also create new employment opportunities. Furthermore, we have planned a large-scale economy based on various sectors, including a port-centric economy.', 'Accordingly, our strategy involves government intervention to build a nation that generates employment.', 'We aim to create within the country job opportunities that allow our youth to engage in professions they desire, based on their abilities and lifestyles. Moreover, we have successfully established a trusted and stable economy today. Building on this stability, we are ready to embark on the journey of transforming the country into a prosperous state. In this process, the youth bear a great responsibility.', 'You possess knowledge and enthusiasm. Through this youth movement, we are prepared to launch a programme aimed at empowering you to become the leaders and pillars of this development. You are not excluded from progress, nor are you obstacles to it. Our goal is to establish you as key stakeholders in the development pathway we have designed.', 'After overcoming a significant and challenging background, you have formed a leadership team. I believe this will enable these young men and women to provide excellent leadership to the country’s youth movement. I wish you success in overcoming the challenges ahead.', 'This occasion was also graced by the presence of Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, Sunil Kumara Gamage, Deputy Minister of Youth Affairs, Eranga Gunasekara, Deputy Minister of Sports, Sugath Thilakaratne, Members of Parliament, foreign Ambassadors, government officials and invited guests, including Chairman/Director General of the National Youth Services Council Attorney-at-Law Supun Wijerathna.']

Therefore, he urged them to choose an alternative political path.', 'President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made these remarks in Parliament today (07) while participating in the adjournment debate to discuss the country’s economic situation.', 'The President appealed to the opposition not to engage in any political activity that would cause instability or economic uncertainty in the country, regardless of their ambitions to come into power. He invited everyone to work together in good faith to lift the country and its people out of their difficulties and create a better standard of living for the citizens.', 'Following is the full speech delivered by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament:', 'I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to present a few points regarding the economy during this debate, which is specifically focused on the country’s economic situation.', 'In recent times, given various international and domestic developments, many hoped the government would collapse. After certain tensions between India and Pakistan, some participants in media discussions even expected bombs to fall on Colombo. But during that conflict, our Defence Secretary and military Commanders were actually in Lahore, Pakistan. The opposition expected a bombing in Colombo.', 'Later, when an international conflict erupted between Israel and Iran, they again anticipated an opportunity would arise for them. But that too did not happen. Then came their greatest hope, that the country’s economy would collapse due to the new tax policies imposed by the United States. Just two days ago, I saw someone claim that U.S. taxes were rising not just to 30%, but to 44%. That’s merely wishful thinking. They claimed India’s rate would fall by 15–20%. The opposition is constantly trapped in a cruel, destructive dream that the country’s economy will fail. But such a collapse will never happen.', 'I wish to clarify the issue of the U.S. tariff imposed on us. The announcement was made on 2nd of April and came into effect from 9th April. When the United States imposes such a tariff, it is based on a principle. The percentage is set at about half of the trade deficit between the two countries. The trade deficit between the U.S. and Sri Lanka is 88%. So, half of that, 44%, is the basis for the tariff imposed on us. That is how we received a 44% tariff. I noticed the opposition also claimed that this 44% tariff was evidence of the government’s failure. But it is not a government failure; it is a result of the principle adopted by the U.S. when imposing such tariffs.', 'It must be openly acknowledged that we entered into these negotiations with the United States at a time when we were in a difficult position. We have reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On the other hand, due to the vast differences in population size and economic scale between the United States and Sri Lanka, comparisons and alignment present significant challenges.', 'Additionally, over 25% of our exports are directed to the United States, which poses a risk of significant impact on our export-driven economy. Nearly 60% of our apparel exports are sent to the United States. Therefore, there exists a risk of direct impact on the livelihoods of nearly 350,000 workers employed in the sector. Hence, we entered into these discussions from a challenging and disadvantaged position. Accordingly, we appointed a highly competent and robust negotiation team.\nAt no stage did we feel the need to have fireworks displays or perform theatrics through the media during each step. However, we were fully aware of the depth and seriousness of this crisis.', 'Therefore, we continuously engaged in discussions and took the necessary steps forward. Our objective was to conclude these discussions positively and resolve the issue in a manner that would not negatively impact on the country’s economy. We successfully overcame that particular challenge. The United States presented us with a number of proposals during the process.\nWe are still at the discussion level regarding those proposals.', 'As of now, no final agreement has been reached and no deal has been signed. However, we have reached some levels of consensus in these talks. As a result of the negotiations, we were able to reduce the tariff rate to 20%, which is a notable outcome. We consider this a significant milestone in the mutual understanding reached between both parties. Our negotiation team achieved this success by continuously assessing and discussing the potential impact on local businesses and industries.', 'This was not a backroom conspiracy hatched by a handful of individuals, but a process of consistent and open dialogue with all relevant stakeholders. Thus, the opposition’s allegations regarding U.S. tariffs will end here. We faced three major external challenges: the U.S. tariffs, the IMF programme and the GSP tax concession scheme.', 'Various groups have spread misinformation in society regarding the IMF programme. We began negotiations with the IMF on the 16th of November.', 'We successfully concluded the third review. We managed to defer the implementation of the service tax. We have also properly concluded the fourth review. There was widespread social unrest concerning electricity tariffs. The Ceylon Electricity Board had driven the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and two state banks into a crisis. The funds meant to be provided to those institutions were taken over by the Treasury.', 'The government has now prepared a clear action plan to safeguard the banks and the Petroleum Corporation. We are of the view that the government must have a presence in both the financial market and the energy market in terms of policy direction. The state’s role must be represented within the financial markets. Prices must be adjusted in line with production costs. We agree with the pricing formula based on this principle. If such adjustments cause hardship to consumers, the government will act to provide relief.', 'Some state institutions were bankrupt; others had zero balances in their accounts. The electricity tariff was determined after carefully considering all of these factors. However, the Opposition Leader announced the new tariff before the government did. The former government had the opportunity to reduce electricity tariffs in 2024. Yet, they failed to do so. We are continuing to implement programmes in collaboration with the IMF. The GSP tax concessions have provided some relief in accessing European markets. If the economy becomes stable, we can endure the absence of these concessions.', 'However, as of now, we still require the GSP concessions. Protecting human rights and democracy in our country is a responsibility of the government. In recent times, the only government to have safeguarded democracy and human rights has been the current one.', 'We have planned to manage the external shocks affecting Sri Lanka in a well-structured manner. The government currently in place has a genuine desire to serve the people. Without creating economic strength, it is not possible to provide relief to the public. The sole challenge faced by this government was to rebuild the collapsed economy. For a whole year, the government has successfully maintained the dollar at around Rs. 300. The opposition expected the dollar to rise to Rs. 400. The black market economy is collapsing. The volatility in the exchange economy is gradually decreasing. Today, no industrialist has uncertainty regarding the dollar. For the first time in Sri Lanka’s history, the dollar has remained stable for a year.', 'When examining Sri Lanka’s export income data from 2015 to 2025, it is evident that the highest-ever export earnings were recorded in the first six months of this year. The export market has been diversified. Of our total exports, 25% go to the United States and 23% to the European Union. Therefore, any tariffs imposed by these countries have a significant impact on Sri Lanka. This is why the government has planned to further diversify exports.', 'We do not intend to rely solely on two or three powerful countries or a few export markets in the future. Comparing June last year with June this year, exports to the African market have grown by 57%. Looking at the Asian market, export activity has expanded by 26% compared to the previous year.', 'We are providing the necessary infrastructure for industrialists. In return, they must pay taxes to the government appropriately. When looking at the tourism sector, this year’s revenue has increased by 10% compared to last year. Therefore, 2025 will become the year with the highest export income and the highest tourism revenue in Sri Lanka’s history. We believe that certain incentives must be provided to encourage foreign direct investment.', 'This year is becoming the year with the highest foreign investment. We need foreign direct investment (FDI). However, we are not a country with vast raw materials or a large market. Attracting FDI requires overcoming major difficulties. Therefore, some incentives must be provided for FDI. In the first six months of last year, FDI amounted to USD 252 million. In the same period this year, it has reached USD 507 million, which is a 101% increase. We expect to earn over USD 1 billion in FDI this year.', 'The Colombo city development project must proceed. Approval has been granted for USD 1,313 million in FDI for this purpose. We must plan accordingly and channel these funds towards development. We bear the burden of past destruction, but we have the opportunity to lead the country towards prosperity.', 'By this December, we will have foreign reserves of USD 7 billion. After five years, we have reopened the vehicle market. As of today, letters of credit worth USD 1,268 million have been opened. Our country has vehicles that are 15 to 20 years old, which can no longer run on the roads. The vehicle sector itself is an industry and must be linked to the national economy. By this December, we expect letters of credit to be opened amounting to USD 1,500–1,800 million.', 'However, there are conspiracies to create pressure on the dollar. Rumours are being spread that vehicle imports will be halted. We wish to assure our citizens that vehicle imports will not be restricted. The open market will continue to operate in its current form.', 'If you cannot buy a vehicle this year, you can buy one next year. Do not engage in actions that harm the country’s economy. There are claims that taxes will be increased, we assure you that taxes on vehicles will not be raised. A country cannot progress by shutting down industrial opportunities. Our aim is to ensure the free movement necessary for the economy. Doubts being raised about our dollar reserves are baseless.', 'Similarly, domestic investments through the Board of Investment have increased. Compared to last year, domestic investments have grown by 18% this year. This leads to job creation and enhanced economic growth.', 'This year has shown signs of becoming the best year for dollar inflows, direct foreign investments, tourism sector and export earnings. When presenting the budget document, we anticipated revenue of approximately Rs. 4.5 trillion. Many said this revenue target was unattainable. They claimed the government was creating an illusion using numbers.', 'The Inland Revenue Department, Customs and the Excise Department have been effectively restructured, increasing their efficiency and working to recover taxes from those evading payment. A list of 200 major tax defaulters has been compiled, with the total value estimated at 100–150 billion. These amounts must be recovered. Is that wrong? There are groups who have defrauded state banks, including politicians and businessmen. We have ensured transparency and independence within the banks.', 'On the revenue side, we have reached a stable and strong level. All sectors have exceeded their revenue targets. We are capable of generating 4.5 trillion in revenue. By July, the Inland Revenue Department surpassed its target by 101%, the Customs Department by 115% and the Excise Department exceeded its Rs. 136 billion target, reaching Rs. 143 billion. During the first seven months, all three major sources of tax revenue have surpassed the goals we set. Therefore, revenue generation for the government is not a concern.', 'There is a crisis in the sugar industry. Production costs are high, there are too many workers and the industry has not been modernised. Due to various reasons, the price of sugarcane was increased three times, resulting in higher costs to produce a kilo of sugar. So what should we do now? Either sell below production cost and let the treasury absorb the loss, or impose taxes on imported sugar to stabilise the price. Are we now willing to impose such taxes? At the very least, a tax of Rs. 50 must be charged. No one should insist on removing taxes from specific sectors. Taxes will be collected from all sectors, while subsidies will be given where appropriate. The government is granting Rs. 1 billion to sugar companies. Reducing taxes serves no purpose if no taxes are paid and salaries are not paid. This issue will be resolved starting this week. We are operating under a rebuilding plan.', 'Today, the government has Rs. 1,000 billion. If treasury bonds are issued, we are the primary buyer. In the past, artificial conditions were created. Today, we can no longer afford such manipulation. We are regulating the market and stopping distortions. Isn’t that how a country should be governed?\nWhen we reflect on the indicators used to assess whether the economy is good or bad, we can see that we have managed to bring the country to a stable position. If the opposition believes the country will collapse due to an economic breakdown that will not happen. In recent times, the economy collapsed due to economic pressure. Then, governments fell due to political crises. People came to the streets and overthrew governments. Some fell through elections. Let it be clear: this government will not fall through any of those means.', 'No one should believe that the power of their own network or circle makes them immune to the law. Yet, such a mindset exists in this country. In a nation where some citizens cannot access justice, even those who can often refuse to submit to the law. Therefore, if we are to rebuild the country, we must once again establish the supremacy of the rule of law.', 'When the rule of law is enforced, the law will reach even those who once believed they were untouchable behind their powerful networks. We have extended our full support to the Criminal Investigation Department and provided the necessary resources and authority to the Bribery or Corruption Commission. They have been empowered to carry out their duties and the law is now actively pursuing criminals.', 'A court order has been issued to arrest a former Navy Commander. However, some are now holding media briefings and claiming that these actions are meant to appease the LTTE diaspora. Let me be clear we have no intention of appeasing anyone. We seek to serve and bring justice to the citizens of this country. Today, criminals are aware that the law is behind them. When a Personal Secretary is summoned to testify, they know exactly what is happening. Before the law reaches them, some attempt to create instability in the country a pattern we’ve seen in the past. This leads to intimidation of law enforcement officers. There have been times in history when officials were even imprisoned for simply conducting fair investigations. There are efforts underway to instil fear among officials.', 'However, we have empowered our officials with the leadership, courage and authority they need. Moreover, we are fully committed to protecting them whenever necessary. Whether we are in government or outside of it, we will stand by every official who is dedicated to upholding the law in this country. Even if we are not in power, as responsible citizens, we assure you that we will continue to protect those officials committed to justice and integrity.', 'I say to the Opposition if you believe this government is unnecessary, then present a programme that shows you are needed. In that case, there is a path forward a conversation we are willing to have. If you believe we are not doing enough for the development of this country, then present your reasoning. We are doing what needs to be done in this moment. If there’s more that should be done, tell us what that is. We inherited a country that had come to a standstill. Many development projects funded by foreign assistance had been suspended. However, today we have revived the economy. For example, the Mirigama–Kadawatha expressway project was originally funded by China’s EXIM Bank. The loan amount granted back then is no longer sufficient a larger loan is now needed.', 'Therefore, discussions must be held to revise the funding. I’m pleased to announce that the EXIM Bank of China has agreed to provide a new loan in Yuan at highly concessional interest rates. We will present this to the Cabinet on Monday, and once approved, work on the expressway can commence.', 'This year, we will begin work on several major projects including the Katunayake Airport and the Kadawatha–Mirigama expressway. We are also making maximum efforts to secure foreign funding for the construction of the Galagedara–Kandy expressway. If those efforts are unsuccessful, we will begin construction next year using domestic funds.', 'Furthermore, we must swiftly move forward with renewable energy projects. We are actively initiating such projects. We are also working to expand the capacity of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Six new oil storage tanks are being built in Kolonnawa. Additionally, the long-delayed rehabilitation of the Trincomalee oil tank farm has now commenced.', 'Stabilizing the energy sector is critically important. Due to the failure to manage past deals by previous leaders, citizens are now paying significantly higher prices for energy. We have now called for tenders to address this.', 'For nearly a year, we have worked tirelessly to stabilize the core fundamentals of this country’s economy. Our financial markets must never again fall into uncertainty. As leaders, we all carry the responsibility of ensuring that. The people of our country must never face a second round of this kind of economic crisis. To avoid this, it is essential to establish a robust and resilient economy from the foundation onward.', 'We need a country where the rule of law is firmly established. Engage in politics as you wish but never even dream of weakening the enforcement of justice against the corrupt. I urge everyone to support the actions necessary to hold wrongdoers accountable. We have begun the effort to rebuild and restore this country. We are not a group who entered politics for personal gain or ambition. Today, for the first time, both local and international investors, industrialists and entrepreneurs know that Sri Lanka’s political authority is not engaging in theft.', 'This is crucial for investment and equally important for building a strong and respected presence on the global stage through sound diplomatic relations. Once, at the United Nations Human Rights Council, our country was perceived in a negative light. For the sake of future generations, we must clean this nation. We must turn this country into a place where our children can live with pride.', 'To do that, the first step is to establish the supremacy of the law. The second is to ensure economic prosperity. The third, we must dismantle the criminal underworld that lurks beneath our society. We know that the underworld, narcotics trade and organized crime are all interconnected and we are confronting them head-on. But we ask for a little more time. This crisis must be overcome. In doing so, we must act with patience and well-thought-out planning.', 'We have laid out plans to rebuild this nation to uplift the economy, ensure a better quality of life for our citizens, create a brighter future for our children, provide high-quality healthcare and develop a modern transportation system. We are rebuilding a nation that was once brought to its knees. That is why we are moving forward with this programme in a stable and determined manner. Let no one even consider trying to obstruct this journey. Do not forget the law stands firm.', 'As we prepare the upcoming budget, we are engaging in consultations with all sectors of society. We are doing our utmost to find solutions to their concerns. This country must transform into an enlightened state once again. For that, we are working with unwavering commitment.', 'You are free to engage in politics but if anyone tries to create chaos in the country as a means to evade justice, we will not allow it. If any group, from anywhere whether underworld elements or defeated factions attempts to engage in political conspiracies, we will not allow those plots to derail this journey toward rebuilding our nation.', 'If the current legal framework is insufficient, we will create the necessary laws. This country must be rebuilt. No one should drag the nation into turmoil simply because they lost their privileges or fear the consequences of justice. Previous governments may have fallen victim to such conspiracies.', 'However, we have already identified these actions. Therefore, if anyone whether, within or outside the state attempts to sabotage the journey to rebuild this country through conspiratorial means, we will take every possible step to defeat such efforts. Today, various distorted claims are being made.', 'But we recognize both the sound at the door and the beating of the drum, we can distinguish truth from deception. So if anyone is even contemplating conspiracy, we will not allow it. You may continue with your politics. But we have now brought the country to a much better path. We are rescuing both the nation and its people from disgrace and hardship. That is our determination and we are working toward it. We request sincere support from the opposition for this cause.', 'A challenge has arisen regarding district development and I assure you, we will address it next. The allocations were genuinely made for the districts. Each Member of Parliament was expected to submit a sufficient number of proposals aligned with the allocated funds for their respective district. When we presented the budget, our expectation was that all MPs would receive their respective allocations. Once the funds were allocated to a district, corresponding proposals were expected from every MP within that district. However, I have received reports that this process has broken down in some areas. I give you my assurance that such lapses will not be allowed in the next year.', 'We tabled the budget document on March 21st. Shortly after that, the provincial council elections were called and those concluded on May 6th. During that period, the Election Commission imposed restrictions, which delayed implementation of some of the proposed projects. Therefore, the real work could only begin after May 6th. That left a limited window, especially since all projects must be completed by December 31st. As a result, some MPs may have missed opportunities to submit their proposals in time.', 'In our system, activities commence only after funds are allocated to the relevant Ministries. But all funds allocated under the 2025 budget will be fully disbursed. We now have the capacity to release those funds. Some delays have occurred in implementation, but moving forward, claims of budgeted funds being withheld will not arise. From 2026 onward, funds will be available starting in January, immediately after the budget is approved. This will ensure early commencement of projects.', 'We do not engage in the kind of politics where funds are withheld from certain individuals. Every Member of Parliament will receive the funds allocated to them. Moreover, in the upcoming budget, we also expect to provide a concessionary vehicle on a returnable basis for use during their term of office.', 'We have laid a very strong foundation for a positive journey, and this is the path we are committed to follow. You are free to represent a different political party and work toward gaining power that is perfectly acceptable. However, I urge you not to engage in conspiracies, not to create instability in the country and not to generate uncertainty about the economy. I request this from everyone.']

['– President says addressing the 41st Annual Convention of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association', 'President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that next year’s budget allocations will be set aside to build a modern public service, following a self-critique of the state, which he described as being in a state of physical and spiritual ruin.\nPresident Dissanayake further stated that the public service must be brought into a culture of modernity and that all possible measures will be taken to protect it.\nThe President said that priority attention has been given in next year’s budget to improving the physical facilities of the public service in order to modernise the state, which he described as being in ruins.\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake expressed these views while attending yesterday’s (05) 41st Annual Convention of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SASA) at Temple Trees as the Chief Guest.\nThe 41st Annual Convention of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association was held at Temple Trees today (05), with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the chief guest and in the presence of Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government, Dr.  Chandana Abayarathna.\nThe Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association is a professional body composed of officers of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, which is the leading island-wide service in the public sector. It is noteworthy that this year’s annual convention was held after a five year hiatus.\nThe President explained that to strengthen the public service, a salary increase proposed in the last budget would be continued, with Rs. 110 Billion allocated for a salary increase next year. He added that the government also plans to allocate Rs. 110 Billion for public service salary increases in 2027.\nThe President stated that the government, as the political authority, is committed to creating an attractive public service and expects the dedication of public administration officials in this endeavour.\nPresident Dissanayake said that for a minority in the public service, their assigned responsibilities has become a transaction and that the public service, which prioritised financial values over social values, must be salvaged from this situation.', 'The President said that the responsibility of public officials towards citizens cannot be confined by circulars or statutes. He added that officials who prioritise social values and social core systems must be created and that the responsibility of public officials is not to oppress others but to use their power to build a good public service and provide the public with a better life.\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the public service has now reached a crossroads and that it is still possible to move forward over time. However, he said that the time has come to evaluate our responsibilities and choose the path necessary to provide an efficient service based on the needs of the citizen.\nThe President said that new experiments should be carried out as required for a new transformative change to create the country that citizens desire and that efforts should be made to restore the ruined state.\nFollowing is the full speech by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake:\n“This is a special occasion. I have met many of you here on various occasions. There are people who studied with me at university and others who were involved in different social activities with me. So, we have met at various times while working in different fields. However, this meeting is more important than all the others. Because you, who are participating in this annual convention of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, one of the foremost services in our public sector and you are a group of people who bear great effort and responsibility for the maintenance of our state. Therefore, I am very happy to have a discussion like this with you.\nAt the beginning of this event, a video presentation was made about the history and development of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. Our administrative service has a long history. Even if you take the period after independence, our political sphere has a long history. As a result, our public service and the political machinery have jointly guided this country for a long time.\nHowever, if we look at the current state of our country, can the political authority and the connected state body be happy with where our country is? We have passed various laws and statutes. We have granted various powers. We have caused various political upheavals. We have changed various titles. But if we look back, I don’t think any of us, if we honestly ask ourselves, can be satisfied with the state of the public service. Putting our own measurement aside, go and ask the average citizen if they are satisfied. They are not satisfied. That’s why your convention is taking place at a very important juncture. At this juncture, we have two paths we can choose from.\nOne is the old, mundane path of simply letting time pass, fulfilling the duties assigned to us only as they arise. It is the path our country has travelled for a long time. It is a very easy path.', 'But there is another path: for each of us to commit to change by honestly evaluating how effectively our role has contributed to building the state and improving people’s lives. This path is not easy, because it is human nature to become comfortable with routine. People often fear change and experimentation. When we continue to perform our daily tasks in the same way, we get used to that routine and learn to manage our responsibilities within that comfort zone.\nHowever, if we choose a new path and are ready to embrace change, we will be challenged by the power of habit. Habit tends to resist transformation and slow down progress. Yet, when we look at the achievements and advancements of human civilization, one thing becomes clear: the key to that progress has been the courage to experiment without fear.\nAdapting to new situations is extremely important. If you fail to adapt, society will leave you behind. That’s why my first request to you is this: be willing to embrace change. Any living being or idea that cannot adjust to new circumstances will soon become irrelevant or disappear. So once again, I urge you to be prepared to adapt.\nHowever, what I’m asking you to do is to adapt to a new situation within a state that is already in ruins. Our state is broken, both physically and spiritually. That is the reality we face. If we are unwilling to confront this harsh truth and instead choose to look away as if we’re merely passing a cemetery, then true transformation will never be possible.\nTherefore, first of all, we need to understand the nature and the truth of the harsh reality that lies before us. We need to be open. We need to bring it to the table for discussion. What is the reality before us? I know that the official vehicles given to the officials here today are old, dilapidated vehicles that are more than 15-16 years old. The computers on your tables are old and in ruins. As a result, the state is physically in ruins. Therefore, we cannot create a modern state from a ruined public service. That is why we will pay special attention in this year’s budget to allocating the necessary funds to provide the facilities and support needed to modernise the public service.\nWe must move swiftly toward digitization, it is the most important transformation in the next phase. However, the power of habit is an obstacle. I’m aware that some institutions have already developed software systems and we acknowledge and appreciate that progress. That’s a good start. At a meeting with District Secretaries, one Secretary shared how she had successfully digitised her office. This was possible because there were officials within that office who supported the change. In other words, it happened due to the personal commitment of the people involved, not as part of a broader, systemic transformation. This is a clear example of how habit continues to resist change.\nNevertheless, we all share a common and sincere goal: to modernise our public service. As part of that effort, we have granted you the highest basic salary increase in recent history.', 'To pay for this salary increase, Rs. 110 Billion is needed this year. In January next year, you will receive another salary increase, which also requires Rs. 110 Billion. A salary increase in 2027 will also require another Rs. 110 Billion. Therefore, to pay for these increased salaries, we will have to bear a cost of Rs. 330 Billion. This is in addition to the salary you are currently being paid. We have to allocate it from the 2027 budget. In this year’s budget, we allocated Rs. 110 Billion. In next year’s budget, it will become Rs. 220 Billion. By 2027, to pay for this total salary increase, we will have to bear a cost of Rs. 330 Billion. We know that in order to make our public service an attractive place, a fair salary scale must be established. We have done that. We have taken steps to provide an 80% salary increase.\nHowever, in certain areas of the state apparatus, we do not see officials taking responsibility for their duties. There have been instances where officials were found keeping money in their lockers. These are issues of ethics and morality. Prisoners have handcuffs and even keys in their possession. What is the root of this problem? A sense of responsibility and social values has been replaced by monetary value. All traces of humanity have been drowned and destroyed in a sea of ice. These are not matters that can be resolved through circulars, directives, or even the constitution. They must be understood as personal responsibilities and social obligations of every citizen.\nIf we are to create a modern public service, we must create a public service with a new spirit, as well as the objectives I mentioned above. Our public service needs a new system of values and principles. We must also recognise the true meaning of values. Values are not about over-consumption or triumphing by oppressing others. Society needs a new core system of values to replace these wrong values and principles. Gentleness, compassion and accountability for one’s assigned responsibilities are all necessary. We are all citizens. And we have all been assigned responsibilities in our respective fields. We must understand that not a single one of those responsibilities should be used to oppress others. The citizens of our country are looking at all of us with a plea. They are looking with pleading eyes to see if you will save our country and our citizens from the current situation. We have no right to ignore this at this time.\nIf you and we do not make this transformation, the citizens of our country will not even dream of a new world and good things. Therefore, we have a role to play in creating these good things.\nThere have been some criticisms and comments regarding certain investigations, but no one should fear this. We understand that officials may have past records and that there are things people have heard or know about one another. However, we are not judging you based on old perceptions or past reputations. Those are not relevant to us.\nWhat matters to us is how you have conducted yourself from the moment you were given your current responsibilities. Past actions will be investigated where necessary. We know that you sign thousands of documents every day. But if that signature that is meant to serve a social purpose, has been misused for personal financial gain, we will take legal action. This must not be seen as a witch hunt against the public service, nor as an attempt to intimidate officials. We have no such agenda.', 'I noticed that a former President recently remarked that the Bribery Commission should be left alone and that no one should interfere or comment on its work. There seems to be a hope that the public will rise up against the Commission’s actions. Some believe this is the path to the government’s downfall. They assume that when the law is enforced, certain individuals will become angry and that this wave of discontent will topple the government.\nBut what does this really mean? It means that the rule of law is being restored. And I would like to ask: is reintroducing proper limits and accountability within the public service truly a reason to bring down a government?\nWe must create a new culture within the public service of this country ourselves. Our goal should be to provide a service that truly satisfies the citizens. Take a moment to find out how many people who visit your office on a Wednesday are repeat visitors and ask why that is.\nLet’s commit fully to transforming our public service into this new culture. You have my full support in this endeavour. Let us become the guardians of every decision made with this purpose in mind. We are not hunters seeking to punish, but rather, we are working to restore our country.\nThis is an effort no one should fear, instead, it should be welcomed and supported. I believe you will stand with me in this important task.\nWe have both the desire and the challenge to lead this country towards a new transformation. If you ask yourself whether you can be proud of this country, it means your heart holds a sincere intention to create a better future for our nation and its people. However, there is currently a gap between these good intentions and our actions. It’s time to begin acting according to your true conscience. Listen to that inner voice. This important work can only succeed if both the political leadership and the public sector work together with a shared purpose.\nWe, as the political authority and you, as the public service, have a responsibility. We will not change that in any way. Let’s perform our duties for a single purpose.\nThere have been many discussions about a common purpose on various occasions and groups of colleagues have worked together as friends. I now call on everyone to unite and make this transformation a reality.\nI wish your convention every success and invite everyone to come together to build a strong public service that provides the people with the facilities they need for a better life.', 'Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya:\nFor a long time, the value and dignity of the public administrative service in our country have been somewhat diminished. Political interference has also played a role in this decline. As a result, public trust in the public administrative service has been eroded. We must reconsider how to restore that trust in a service with such a long and proud history. As the political authority, we are committed to intervening in order to establish governance that is truly centred on the people.\nThe political authority will do everything possible to transform the vital work you do into a service centred on the people. Your contribution is essential to making this transformative change a reality. We will neither ask you to act improperly in the public service nor tolerate such behaviour. It is within this foundation of trust that real transformation can take place in our country.We ask you to carry out your duties grounded in that trust. We believe this trust will empower you to effectively implement the policies designed for the benefit of the nation.\nDr. Hans Wijayasuriya, Chief Advisor to the President on Digital Economy:\nWith the power of digitisation in the public service, citizens can receive more efficient and timely services. To progress as a country with capabilities on an international level, digitisation is essential for our public administrative service. Just as Sri Lankan cricket and our rich history have earned a special place in the world, the public service too can gain global recognition through digitisation. Therefore, we must not miss this important opportunity.\nThe role played by the public administrative service in helping the country recover swiftly from the previous economic crisis was crucial. The international community, observing Sri Lanka during that difficult time, doubted that such a rapid recovery was possible. Yet, the Sri Lankan public administrative service rose to the challenge and carried that great responsibility.\nWith the addition of digitisation, it will become even more achievable to elevate Sri Lanka onto the global stage. Digitisation has the ability to create a world-class system of governance. Therefore, this opportunity should be seized without hesitation.\nMeanwhile, a research journal prepared by the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association was also presented to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.\nMinisters, Governors, Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development, Thilaka Jayasundara, Ministry Secretaries and officials and members of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association, including the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government Dr.  Chandana Abayarathna, were among those who attended the event.']

As a result, many professional singers have experienced unfair treatment.

He stated that a new political culture has been created in the country, replacing the corrupt political system and that the current government has taken steps to breathe new life into the stagnant economy. The President also mentioned that the rule of law is now actively enforced across the country, applying equally to everyone.\nThe President urged everyone to “work together to build a better country for future generations, ensuring they do not inherit the hardships faced by the current generation and to create a future full of hope and aspirations.” He also thanked all Sri Lankans residing in the Maldives who dedicated themselves to the victory of the National People’s Power government in the last Presidential and General Elections.\nFurthermore, the President answered questions raised by the community concerning the current situation in Sri Lanka and issues faced by the Sri Lankan expatriate in the Maldives.\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake, addressing the Sri Lankan community in the Maldives, further stated:', '“During the last presidential election, we met with Sri Lankans abroad. The Maldives has become the first country where I, as President, have addressed the expatriate Sri Lankan community. I believe many of you here wished to see our country become a very developed nation and for its people to achieve a higher standard of living.\nIt’s not enough for each of us to have individual assessments of our country. To make it a reality, we had to gain political power. In the last presidential and general elections, with the support of all of you, we received the political change and power needed to transform our country for the better. Just as I stated before you then, we will not allow the trust you placed in us to waver even slightly. Why did the people choose us for a new political change?', 'Back then, our country had one law for the rich and powerful and another for the poor and vulnerable. Therefore, the people desired the re-establishment of the supremacy of the rule of law in the country. Additionally, our country had an ugly political culture where the political authority enjoyed privileged positions, acting above citizens rather than engaging with them. So, the people wanted to end this ugly political culture and build a new, more accessible political culture. There was also a desire to eliminate the rampant fraud, corruption, bribery and waste that permeated our entire state machinery.\nFurthermore, due to the highly unsuccessful and flawed economic policies pursued by our state for a long time, our country had become largely economically bankrupt and the people of this country had hoped for an economic revival. The people gave us power hoping for a new transformation in these and many other areas. The people of this country, marking a profoundly significant political leap in world history, elevated us to the highest political position. A political movement that received 3% in the previous election achieved an exceptional victory in the subsequent general election, electing the highest number of MPs in Sri Lankan history to Parliament.\nEvery one of you contributed to that political transformation. That’s why today I am the President, our Cabinet is formed and a significant power block has been created in Parliament,  it is all thanks to the contribution given by the people of our country, including yourselves. This power was not created by wealth, nor by media influence, nor by any inherited power. This power was not created on the basis of our family lineage or background. This entire power was created by the people of the country. Therefore, as President and as the Cabinet, we have an undeniable, inalienable responsibility. We will protect the trust you have placed in us.\nI know there’s a lot of noise out there. All of that is an expression of defeat, uncertainty about power and political failure, not reality. The reality is that we are slowly but steadily building our country. We will free our country and its people from the challenges they face.\nIt was your expectation to see a very strong rule of law implemented in our country. How was the law enforced in our country back then? Power bent the law. The law was trampled upon. Rulers believed they should be above the law. But today, we are happy to say that the supremacy of the rule of law has been established, irrespective of status. We have no personal desire for revenge against anyone. However, we have a sincere desire that citizens must be subject to the law. Power, wealth, or position are not the criteria that determine whether one is subject to the law or not.\nOur country needs a new political culture. Everyone must be equal before the law. And everyone is subject to the law. Everyone should fear the law. There was an era in our country when people did not fear the law. We must gradually transform our country into a society where citizens are subject to the law and show some fear of it. People should be afraid to engage in fraud or accept bribes. Yet, amassing great wealth became a tool for being above the law. An era was created where state property and public funds were wasted on a grand scale. We are building a state where everyone is equal before the law. We will make Sri Lanka a country where people are not only afraid to take bribes but even to think about taking one.', 'You know, the head of the prison has been arrested. Officials from the Department of Motor Traffic and Customs have been arrested. The Inspector General of Police is under arrest. A large number of former police officers have been suspended. A former Navy Commander has also been arrested. All these individuals were above the law and manipulated it as they wished. Today, we are enforcing the law without regard for rank or status. We are doing this to uphold the supremacy of the rule of law, which was a key expectation of the mandate the people gave us.\nThe fraud and corruption that plagued our country’s political authority must be eradicated. I can give you one guarantee: for the first time, we have established a government that will not steal a single cent of public money. We have completely stopped the bribery, corruption and waste that enveloped the political authority. However, there’s a state mechanism that runs on habit. I know there are people who don’t pay taxes to the Inland Revenue Department. We have a list of those who portray themselves as very wealthy, luxurious businessmen but have defaulted on payments to state banks.\nThere was a tendency to commit fraud and corruption, evading taxes owed to the government. The banking system, which was eager to auction off the properties of good individuals, provided protection to those with political patronage. Therefore, the people of our country had a desire to stop fraud and corruption. This has now been achieved within the political authority and we will do the rest.\nFurthermore, the people of this country wanted to see those who committed fraud and corruption punished. Punishing the corrupt is not, personally speaking, the President’s task. Laws are needed to punish the corrupt. We have a very strong law, the Public Property Act. If public funds exceeding Rs. 25,000 are misappropriated, there is no bail.\nUnder the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, if one cannot show how wealth was acquired, that wealth can be confiscated. Additionally, a law for the confiscation of illegally acquired property was passed in Parliament on April 8th.\nTherefore, the necessary laws to combat bribery and corruption have been enacted. We also need to activate the institutions for this purpose. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption has been provided with the necessary legislation. The necessary institutions have been established and buildings have been provided for them to operate their offices. We are also planning to place the officials of the Bribery or Corruption Commission on a higher salary scale very soon. In this way, we are providing the necessary facilities. We have made the necessary changes and provided facilities to the Criminal Investigation Department and the Attorney General’s Department.\nChanging this ugly political culture in our country was a major goal of the people. Today, we are changing that culture. As President, I have a responsibility. Similarly, as the Cabinet, as state officials, as ambassadors, everyone has a responsibility. We are obliged to fulfil these responsibilities. In the past, the political authority was above all this. And sometimes, the people of our country even expected such a thing. But today, we are all striving to fulfil the responsibilities entrusted to us. Therefore, instead of the political culture that existed in our country, where politicians were above the public, we have taken steps towards a new political culture that integrates\nthe political authority, the state machinery and the public, shoulder to shoulder, for this transformation.', 'Another primary expectation of the people was to strengthen the country’s economy. If the economy is not strong, it’s difficult to establish the rule of law, a good culture, or a state with reduced crime. Therefore, our biggest challenge was to create a strong economy. We were a bankrupt country two or three years ago. Even a hundred years from now, if the economic history of Sri Lanka is written, 2022-2023 will have a separate chapter dedicated to it. It is something that can never be erased from the country’s economic history.\nWith our country becoming bankrupt, trust in the financial system began to collapse. As a result of bankruptcy, investments stopped coming into Sri Lanka. All ongoing projects came to a halt. Inflation reached nearly 70%. Trust in the dollar completely began to crumble. Bank interest rates increased dramatically. A situation was created where no one would start a new business. It became impossible to import medicines, gas and fuel. As a country and a society, we faced the consequences of the economic policies pursued for a long time. The victims of this economic problem were by no means those who were involved in those decisions.\nWe didn’t inherit a country that was running well. We inherited a country that was grinding to a halt. Our initial step was to figure out how to revive this stagnant state. When we took over the government, debt restructuring discussions had already begun. We concluded the debt restructuring programme on December 21st last year. This is the biggest turning point in this economic transformation.\nSince 2022, we had become a country that did not repay its debts. However, on December 21st, 2024, we reached an agreement with the lending countries that we would start repaying debts from 2028. Now we are officially free from bankruptcy. Accordingly, agreements have been made to gradually restart stalled projects. Especially, all development projects provided to our country by China, India and Japan will largely recommence before the end of this year. This is the first step in a country that had come to a standstill.\nWe also need dollars. We are very happy to say that there are three main factors contributing to us receiving dollars. The first group is you, the expatriate Sri Lankans. We would like to say that this year will be the year with the highest dollar remittances from overseas Sri Lankans. The second source of dollars for the country is tourism. This year will be the year with the highest number of tourist arrivals and the highest dollar earnings from tourism in Sri Lankan history.\nThe third source is export revenue. Regarding export revenue, 2025 will be the year with the highest export earnings in Sri Lanka. In this way, a very strong stability has been created in the economy. As a result, we have managed to maintain the dollar’s value around the 300 rupee mark for nearly a year now.\nFor five years, vehicle imports in our country were stopped. We have opened up the vehicle market. As of yesterday, we have opened LCs worth USD 1200 million for vehicle imports. However, the dollar remains stable. This reflects a very important characteristic of the economy.', 'Foreign direct investment is also a very important part of the economy. This year, so far, USD 563 million in foreign direct investment has come through the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka. This is a 101% increase compared to last year. Especially in Port City, we have approved four new projects. In addition to foreign direct investment, a large amount of investment has also been received by the Port City.\nSimilarly, bank interest rates are also a crucial factor. Bank interest rates had risen to 30%-35%. This was a very bad situation. No one would take a loan at such an interest rate to run a business. Therefore, money flowed into fixed deposits, or was invested in treasury bills and bonds. Banks began lending to the government.\nFor a long time, the government’s account in our country was in the negative. Not only have our country’s dollar reserves improved, but the Central Bank is now maintaining a reserve of Rs. 01  trillion. Bank interest rates have been kept at single digits for the longest period. This is a very important factor for the economy.\nForeign reserves currently stand at USD 6.3 billion and we expect to accumulate foreign reserves exceeding USD 7 billion by the end of this year. We have to repay debts by 2028. In the debt restructuring programme, a large burden does not fall in the initial years. The amount increases slightly in 2032. Therefore, we have a good six years to prepare well.\nAccording to the commitment between us and the International Monetary Fund, we can obtain commercial loans in 2028. However, our utmost effort is to strengthen dollar reserves without taking commercial loans. Why were we plunged into this crisis? Commercial loans. For the first time in Sri Lanka, we went to the market and obtained commercial loans in 2007. The administration from 2007-2015 obtained USD 3.5 billion in commercial loans. These loans, taken at high interest rates, trapped us in a debt trap. During the period of 2015-2019, when economic experts governed, we obtained USD 12.5 billion in commercial loans. We could not repay these short-term, high-interest loans.\nEven though we will have the ability to obtain loans in 2027, our maximum effort is to achieve debt repayment capability without taking any commercial loans. Therefore, even though people say a debt crisis is coming or the country will collapse in 2028, none of that will happen.\nIn Sri Lanka, typically, a government’s revenue is estimated in the budget. Except for last year, in every preceding year, the estimated revenue was not received. However, this year, for the first time in Sri Lanka, the government is earning more than the estimated revenue. In this way, we have achieved economic victories.\nHowever, we face the challenge of how to extend these high-level economic achievements to the ordinary people. It’s pointless showing economic growth in data if the lives of the people are not improving. But, without creating stability in high economic data, we cannot even consider uplifting the lives of the common people. Therefore, as a first step, we have stabilised the country’s economy. Investors are now coming to the country. We are creating the necessary environment for these investors within the country. Now, we need to ensure that the benefits flow to the people of the country. We will focus on this in the next budget.', 'A good state mechanism must operate within the country. Our entire state mechanism was in ruins. Vehicles and equipment were old, buildings were dilapidated. To move our country forward from these ruins, a modernised government, suitable for the present, is needed. Therefore, in the upcoming budget, we will place a greater emphasis on modernising the government.\nWe are very successfully completing digitisation. The digital identity card is a very important step in our country’s digitisation. Furthermore, with digitisation, governance will be elevated to a very important level. We will carry out this digital transformation within these four years to elevate the country to a new level.\nEducation is a very important area for improving the lives of rural people. Therefore, we expect a major modernisation of the school system. Our education system is flawed. Our education is on a single linear path. Education should be open to a wide range of possibilities. We will not allow any child who enters school to leave without a vocational or academic skill. Therefore, we are making a major shift in education for societal change.\nAlso, to uplift rural livelihoods, the economic sectors they are engaged in must be developed. Here, agriculture and fisheries must become profitable businesses. The old era of agriculture is over. Today’s supply chain is not seasonal but continuous. Accordingly, we must move to new cultivation plans. We have prepared plans for this. Our products must go out of the country.\nWe also need to create new economic opportunities. The facilities that the government should provide must be provided quickly. In particular, we need a strong public transport service. The cost incurred by citizens for their transport facilities in our country is very high. Therefore, we have prepared plans to develop public transport.\nThe energy sector is also a crucial area. For a long time, the Kelanitissa and Kerawalapitiya power plant systems have been running on naphtha and furnace oil. We will very quickly convert them to LNG. This will enable us to reduce energy costs.\nThere are also several sectors like education, health and agriculture. If we consider the health sector, it’s true that there are medicine shortages in some places. But that’s not a money problem. There’s a crisis in our procurement system. Recently, I summoned everyone in the supply sector. Typically, we have about 6000 tenders. The problem is not simple. Therefore, we will very quickly discuss with the Procurement Commission and move towards a new procurement process for medicine purchases. In this budget, we have allocated sufficient funds for medicines and equipment. However, a large number of tenders for next year have already been called and concluded.\nWe also plan to establish 200 primary healthcare centres this year. A community health centre will be established for every Grama Seva division so that every family has a doctor. Annually, 60 million people receive treatment from the outpatient departments of hospitals. The population is 20 million. That means each person has visited three or four times. We need a strong community health service.', 'We consider developing health, education and transport as the foremost tasks of our government. Only then can the lives of the people be uplifted. If the government bears the cost of these, citizens will have more income left. That’s how living standards should be improved. Because this government is working with a very good plan, we believe we can elevate our country from its current position to a much higher one.\nIn this journey, expatriate Sri Lankans play a significant role. We are very grateful for your work in gaining power and protecting it. We also understand the problems you face. Especially, we are paying attention to the difficulties in repatriating bodies if someone unexpectedly passes away in the Maldives. It is the responsibility of our government to care for every Sri Lankan citizen, no matter where they live in the world. Therefore, we are focusing on the problems you face. The Maldivian President has agreed to provide us with 90-day visas.\nLet’s work together with the hope of creating a better country than the one we were born into, a country where our children don’t suffer the hardships we did and a future generation with more hopes and aspirations than us. This is the government for that. We ask about what we don’t know. We are ordinary people, not distorted individuals with seven brains. Our specialty is that we absorb capabilities. We give opportunities to those who know. We have no competition. That’s why people from various fields are voluntarily working in our government today. We have given them the necessary freedom. Building this country is the task of everyone with these capabilities. We are undertaking this journey by unifying all these individuals. Thank you once again for your contribution to this endeavour.']
