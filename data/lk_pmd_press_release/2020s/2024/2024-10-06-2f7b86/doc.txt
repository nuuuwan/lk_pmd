Congratulatory Message
Education has been the driving force behind the progress of every developed nation in recent times. Recognizing this, our government views education as the most essential tool for advancing our country and fostering a new era of growth.
At the heart of this mission are you, our dedicated teachers. You have the unique ability to shape the minds of the students in your care, preparing them to engage with the vast knowledge of the world and empowering them to succeed.
The teaching profession is rooted in a deep, immeasurable love—one that transcends salary or recognition. It is a noble calling, honoured by society as both “teacher-mother” and “teacher-father.”
We understand that teachers have their own aspirations for the future. Our goal is to support you in realizing those dreams and elevating the respect and pride of the teaching profession. We are committed to building a society where teachers are valued, respected, and never subjected to unjust treatment.
On this World Teacher’s Day, we honour all teachers and parents who have devoted themselves to nurturing and guiding the next generation towards a brighter future.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake
President
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
