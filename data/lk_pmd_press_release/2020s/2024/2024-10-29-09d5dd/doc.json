    "\u2013 President\u2019s Remarks to the Sri Lanka Banks\u2019 Association",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that, since neither he nor his administration has special ties or obligations to any party within the country\u2019s development or business sectors, they are positioned to make decisions impartially and decisively for the sake of national economic recovery.",
    "These remarks were made during a meeting today (29) with members of the Sri Lanka Banks\u2019 Association at the Presidential Secretariat, where discussions focused on the banking sector\u2019s role and challenges in supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth.",

He stressed that the approach should ensure security and mutual benefit for both banks and entrepreneurs.",
    "Discussing the informal sector, President Dissanayake noted its substantial role within Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. He emphasized that any steps to formalize this sector must prioritize the safety and welfare of those currently relying on it for their livelihoods.",
