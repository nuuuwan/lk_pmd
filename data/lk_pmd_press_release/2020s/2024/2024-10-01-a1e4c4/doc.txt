President Instructs Two-Week Suspension of Scholarship Exam Answer Sheet Evaluation
A meeting took place yesterday afternoon (30) at the Presidential Secretariat between President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and a group of parents who had protested regarding the recent Grade 5 Scholarship Examination question paper issue.
Following the discussion, the President directed the relevant officials to suspend the evaluation of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination answer sheets for two weeks.
Additionally, the parents requested that the President consider holding a re-examination for the first paper of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, as they claimed eight questions, not three, were leaked prior to the exam.
