    "It is with profound sorrow that I extend heartfelt condolences on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka on the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis, a global moral compass and a deeply respected voice for peace, justice and compassion.",
    "Pope Francis\u2019 unwavering commitment to the poor, his tireless call for global unity and his spiritual leadership touched millions across all faiths. In Sri Lanka, his memory is held with special affection. His historic visit to our island nation in January 2015 remains etched in our collective memory, a moment of spiritual healing and interfaith solidarity following years of national struggle. His presence brought comfort, hope and a renewed call for reconciliation and compassion among our diverse communities.",
    "The Catholic community of Sri Lanka numbering nearly 1.7 million faithful joins the global Church in mourning this irreplaceable loss. But beyond denomination, all Sri Lankans who value peace, humility and human dignity will remember him as a friend of the people and a beacon of moral clarity in turbulent times.",
    "May his legacy of compassion, justice and interfaith harmony continue to inspire generations to come.",
    "May His Holiness rest in eternal peace."
