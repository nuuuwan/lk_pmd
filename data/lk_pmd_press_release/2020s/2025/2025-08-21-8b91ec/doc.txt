Students of the Jaffna Education Zone’s Student Parliament Visit the Presidential Secretariat
A group of students from 14 schools representing the Student Parliament of the Jaffna Education Zone, had the opportunity recently to participate in the “Vision” programme organized by the Presidential Secretariat.
This programme is jointly implemented by the Presidential Secretariat, the Ministry of Education and the Department of Communication of the Parliament for the benefit of schoolchildren.

During the visit, the students were also briefed on the “Clean Sri Lanka” programme and its conceptual significance.
In line with this initiative, valuable plants were presented to schools as symbolic gifts highlighting the importance of environmental conservation.
Senior Additional Secretary to the President Prasanna Chandith, Assistant Director of the Presidential Secretariat’s Tri-Forces Coordination Unit Major Nadika Dangolla, principals, teachers and parents of the participating schools were also present at the occasion.
