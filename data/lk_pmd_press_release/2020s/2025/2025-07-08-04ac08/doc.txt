The discussion focused extensively on identifying solutions to challenges arising from the complexity of customs procedures.

In this context, the President instructed officials to expedite the process of amending existing legislations, identifying it as a key challenge that must be addressed without delay.

The discussion focused on digitalization as a means to address these issues and assessed the progress of measures already implemented.
Additionally, the President addressed the growing concerns surrounding e-commerce and called on officials to deliver efficient and fair, customer-centric solutions to the issues currently faced in this area.
