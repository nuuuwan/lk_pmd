    "During the meeting, President Disanayake expressed his profound appreciation for the IMF\u2019s continued support in recovering from the catastrophic economic crisis of 2022. He highlighted the significant progress Sri Lanka has made in implementing economic reforms, strengthening macroeconomic stability, supporting the vulnerable and improving governance.

He emphasized the importance of ongoing collaboration to ensure the resilience of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy amidst global economic uncertainties.",
    "Ms. Georgieva congratulated the President for ensuring macroeconomic stability and completing the 3rd review under the EFF, as well as the successful completion of the bond exchange and most of the debt restructuring. The Managing Director commended Sri Lanka\u2019s efforts in pursuing key reforms and reaffirmed the IMF\u2019s commitment to supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s economic agenda. Ms. Georgieva underlined the importance of strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals with good governance frameworks, especially in the wake of high global uncertainties, slowing global growth, and rising global debt levels.",
    "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reaffirmed his commitment to move forward with the IMF program while ensuring that the agreed-upon targets align with the aspirations of the Sri Lankan people, reflecting their strong democratic mandate. The President emphasized that the government remains dedicated to implementing the necessary mechanisms to uplift the underprivileged while prioritizing the strengthening of social welfare expenditures as a key policy focus. The President highlighted the government\u2019s dedication to enhancing state-owned enterprises through improved governance and cost-recovery pricing, including for electricity. He also stressed the importance of securing foreign direct investment and support from multilateral partners to reduce debt vulnerabilities and promote sustainable and inclusive growth. President Disanayake reassured the IMF of the government\u2019s commitment to successfully completing the remaining reviews under the EFF.",
    "Looking ahead, Ms. Georgieva emphasized the need to persevere with the reform agenda under the program to decisively put Sri Lanka on the path to sustainable and equitable growth. She acknowledged that the journey to sustained recovery remains challenging, particularly given rapid global developments in technology and geopolitics. The Managing Director underscored the IMF\u2019s\nrole as a steadfast partner of Sri Lanka and highlighted that the IMF stands ready to support Sri Lanka\u2019s endeavors to foster inclusive growth, alleviate poverty, and enhance the quality of life for its people.",
