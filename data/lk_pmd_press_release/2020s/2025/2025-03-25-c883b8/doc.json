The event was conducted under the patronage of Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya.",
    "During the session, the student parliament members of Visakha Vidyalaya had the opportunity to gain insights into the conceptual and practical significance of the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d initiative.",
    "A special commemorative edition of the \u2018Vision\u2019 magazine, which focuses on the student Parliament initiative, was presented to the Prime Minister by Nadeeka Dangolla, Assistant Director of Parliamentary Affairs and Executive Functions.",
    "Furthermore, the Principal of Visakha Vidyalaya, Mrs. Manomi Seneviratne, presented a special commemorative token to Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya.",
    "Addressing the gathering, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya highlighted that the government\u2019s commitment to implementing new educational reforms aimed at nurturing a generation capable of seizing economic opportunities.",
    "The Prime Minister further stated that the government aims to prepare Sri Lankan children to acquire global knowledge while fostering a self-reliant and empowered future generation.",
    "The Prime Minister stated that the objective of the new education reforms is not only to align education with job market demands but also to cultivate skilled youth who can contribute to the economy and provide leadership to society.",
    "Furthermore, she underscored the government\u2019s commitment to addressing resource disparities among schools and emphasized the significance of civic responsibility in this endeavour.",
    "Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne\n\u2018Leadership must be devoid of selfishness. Selfless leaders guide both the nation and its people towards a better direction. To achieve this, skills must be enhanced. We can learn about talented leaders from both Sri Lankan history and global history. We should study as children how Chandashoka transformed into Dharmashoka and how Hitler\u2019s regime brought devastation to the world. A nation achieves stability when leaders who prioritize minimal personal consumption and demonstrate a true dedication to their nation arise. Therefore, we must strive to cultivate leaders who can face challenges and prioritize national interests. By fostering selflessness, we can ensure a prosperous future for our people.\u2019",
    "Senior Presidential Media Advisor Mr. Chandana Sooriyabandara\n\u2018The students gathered here today are not just future leaders; they are leaders already. Leadership knows no age. Anyone who stands for a group could be consider as a leader. Those who exercise the power of the group are considered leaders. Throughout Sri Lankan history, individuals who contributed to the country through their words and actions have played leadership roles. Therefore, logical reasoning should lead the process of making decisions. Both leaders and citizens share the duty to act rationally. You all have a duty to shape a prosperous nation through logical thinking, and this obligation lies with every young person.\u2019",
    "The event was also attended by Deputy Speaker Dr. Rizvie Salih, Deputy Chairperson of Committees Hemali Weerasekara, Secretary-General of the Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera, Senior Additional Secretary to the President K.M.N. Kumarasinghe, Director-General of Legal Affairs to the President J.M. Wijebandara, Principal of Visakha Vidyalaya Manomi Seneviratne, along with members of the teaching staff and a group of students."
