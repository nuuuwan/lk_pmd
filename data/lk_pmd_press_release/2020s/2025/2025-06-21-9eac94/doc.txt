Athkanda Rajamaha Viharaya Historic Sri Dalada Poson Perahera Centenary Celebration held under the President’s  Patronage
The centenary inauguration ceremony of the historic Sri Dalada Poson Perahera at the Athkanda Rajamaha Viharaya in Kurunegala was held this afternoon (21) with the participation of President Anura Kumara Disanayake.
The annual Sri Dalada Poson Perahera, which commenced in 1925, marked its 100th anniversary this year. To commemorate this milestone, a special commemorative stamp and a replica of the original procession cover were unveiled. The event also featured the launch of two scholarly publications focused on the Perahera and the debut performance of a dedicated procession song.
President Disanayake presented awards and certificates to students who excelled in various competitions held in parallel with the centenary celebrations. In his address, the President stressed that no society, regardless of its material progress, can thrive without spiritual and moral foundations. He noted that a nation’s cultural and social development must be rooted in ethical and spiritually aware citizens.
Highlighting the relevance of Buddhist Jataka stories and cultural traditions, the President remarked that these offer a valuable foundation for reviving spiritual life in a society increasingly consumed by the pursuit of wealth and power. He added that Buddhism teaches rulers to govern with compassion and accountability, values that are unfortunately eroding in modern times. He called for collective efforts to restore these cultural roots and to foster a spiritually enriched society.
Responding to critics, the President stated that despite claims that the current government would abandon such traditions, the day’s celebration clearly demonstrated its commitment to preserving and promoting Sri Lanka’s cultural and spiritual heritage.
The ceremony was attended by Most Venerable Niyangoda Sri Vijithasiri Thera, Anunayaka of the Malwatu Chapter; Venerable Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Thera, Chief Incumbent of the Athkanda Rajamaha Viharaya and the Maha Sangha; North Western Province Governor Tissa Varnasuriya; Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Dr. Hiniduma Sunil Senevi; State Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Prof. Chandana Abeyratne; State Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala; Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Namal Karunaratne; and Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela, along with a large gathering of devotees and officials.
