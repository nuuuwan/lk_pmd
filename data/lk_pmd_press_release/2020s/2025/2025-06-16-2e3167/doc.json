    "During the meeting, President Disanayake expressed his sincere appreciation to the IMF for its continued support in guiding Sri Lanka through its recent financial crisis.

The President further highlighted the challenges posed by on-going global conflicts and their potential implications for Sri Lanka. However, he mentioned to the delegation that appropriate measures are being taken to manage and mitigate these risks effectively.",

The President emphasized the current government\u2019s interest in expanding investment opportunities, stating that economic recovery would be driven through increased investor confidence. He reiterated that the current administration is people-oriented and committed to advancing in close alignment with public aspirations.",
    "Ms. Gopinath thanked the President for the warm welcome and acknowledged the strong mandate he received in both the general and local elections, which she noted enhances the government\u2019s ability to implement much-needed reforms. Reflecting on the country\u2019s economic journey, she commended the remarkable progress achieved over the past two years from a state of severe crisis to renewed growth and falling inflation.",
    "She also praised the strides made in governance reforms and emphasized the importance of sustaining and deepening these efforts. The IMF delegation reaffirmed its recognition of Sri Lanka\u2019s substantial progress and pledged to remain a steadfast partner in the country\u2019s reform and recovery process.",
