    "The Vesak Full Moon Poya Day, which marks the Birth, Enlightenment and Parinirvana of the Lord Buddha, is a day of profound significance for Buddhists worldwide. It was on such a sacred Vesak Day that the Buddha, having fulfilled the Perfections (P\u0101ramit\u0101s), vanquished the forces of M\u0101ra, cultivated wisdom through the Middle Path, realised the Four Noble Truths and eradicated all defilements to attain Supreme Enlightenment (Samm\u0101 Sambuddha).",
    "Throughout countless lifetimes, the Buddha endured suffering, perfected virtues and ultimately discovered the Dhamma, a timeless truth for the spiritual well-being of all beings. His core teaching was not merely religious but a path to inner development, guiding humanity towards moral and intellectual growth.",
    "The Buddhist philosophy also provides profound insights into good governance. As the Buddha taught:",
    "\u201cSabbam r\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e41 sukha\u1e41 seti \u2013 R\u0101j\u0101 ce hoti dhammiko\u201d (The whole country thrives in happiness \u2013 if its ruler is righteous.)\nThis underscores that when a nation\u2019s leader governs with justice and virtue, the people prosper in peace.",
    "Inspired by the Buddha\u2019s teachings, we must strive to build a prosperous nation rooted in selflessness, equality and social justice, fulfilling the aspirations of our people for a \u201cA Thriving Nation \u2013 A Beautiful Life.\u201d Let us unite with determination and diligence to achieve this noble vision.",
    "Moreover, the Buddha\u2019s message of peace remains ever-relevant. In a world torn by conflict and division, we must embrace the Four Brahmavih\u0101ras, Loving-kindness (Mett\u0101), Compassion (Karun\u0101), Altruistic Joy (Mudit\u0101) and Equanimity (Upekkh\u0101), to foster global harmony.\nMay this auspicious Vesak Festival illuminate all hearts with the light of Dhamma!"
