Students of Nittambuwa Sanghabodhi National School Visit President’s House
A group of students from Nittambuwa Sanghabodhi National School visited the Presidential Secretariat and the President’s House this morning (18).
The visit was facilitated under the Vision programme series, a collaborative initiative for schoolchildren organised by the Presidential Secretariat, the Ministry of Education and the Department of Communication of the Parliament of Sri Lanka.
As part of the visit, the students toured the Old Parliament building located within the Presidential Secretariat and received a briefing on the history of parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka.
The students and teaching staff were also educated on the Clean Sri Lanka initiative, spearheaded by President Anura Kumara Disanayake, as well as on the functions of the executive branch and the importance of the rule of law.
To symbolically emphasise the importance of environmental preservation, Mr K.M.N. Kumarasinghe, Senior Additional Secretary to the President, presented the school with a valuable plant sapling.
Among those in attendance were Colonel Dhananjaya Senarath, Deputy Director of the Tri-Forces Security Operations Coordinating Unit; Mr N.A.L. Wijerathna, Principal of Nittambuwa Sanghabodhi National School; and members of the school’s teaching staff.
