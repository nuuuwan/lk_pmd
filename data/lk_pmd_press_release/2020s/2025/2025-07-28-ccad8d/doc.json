Similarly, we acknowledge the contribution made by the Maldivian expatriates in Sri Lanka to the Sri Lankan economy and society.",

My Government has embarked on the \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 Programme which is implemented through the three main pillars of social development, environmental development and ethical development to sustainably elevate Sri Lanka and the entire Sri Lankan society to a higher level. While commending President Muizzu for the successful implantation of the \u2018Maldives Clean Environment\u2019 Project for solid waste management, we acknowledged the importance of the collaborative efforts in countering the challenge of climate change and global warming.",
