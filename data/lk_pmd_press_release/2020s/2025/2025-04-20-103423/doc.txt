Presidential Commission Report on Easter Sunday Attacks  handed over to CID by Presidential Order
Under direct instructions from President Anura Kumara Disanayake, the final report and all accompanying volumes of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Easter Sunday attacks were formally submitted today (20) to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).
Since the National People’s Power Government came into power, the inquiry has been fast‑tracked and reoriented to ensure it remains fully independent and impartial.
Timed to coincide with the sixth anniversary of the coordinated 2019 bombings, the revamped investigation highlights the government’s commitment to transparency and accountability.
President Disanayake reaffirmed his pledge to secure justice for the victims, vowing that these heinous crimes will not be allowed to fade into obscurity.
