    "The President mentioned that we must reconsider whether we, as a nation, have successfully embraced the new transformation that occurred in the twentieth century, which brought triumphs to the world. The President highlighted that numerous countries, which were previously behind us, surpassed us in the latter part of the twentieth century by swiftly integrating the advancements of that era into their own nations.",
    "The President further stated that we have not succeeded in securing the future of the world and at times, in safeguarding our historical heritage.

President Dissanayake noted, inspires confidence that the nation has a future. \u201cOur goal is to progress as a nation that is linked to these cultural opportunities.
