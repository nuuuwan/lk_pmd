Must build a spiritually enriched society that revives discipline and humanity
– President
President Anura Kumara Disanayake emphasized the urgent need to rebuild a disciplined and virtuous society by restoring the spirit of humanity in a social environment where power and wealth have undermined positive values and fostered detrimental ones. The President noted that the Maha Sangha of the country can play a significant role in guiding this transformation.
The President made these remarks while participating in the inauguration of the 74th Upasampadha (higher ordination) religious ceremony of Sri Lanka Ramanna sect, held this afternoon (30) at the Mahaweli Grounds in Galnewa.
President Disanayake emphasized that alongside the material victories we aim to achieve, there are also many spiritual triumphs we should pursue. He emphasized that a nation which once listened to the Dhamma preached for centuries based on loving-kindness, compassion and non-violence must now reflect on its present fate and recognize the repercussions of deviating from those principles.
Underscoring the collective responsibility of building a disciplined and virtuous society, the President called on all citizens to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to this mission without delay. He further stated that preserving the continuity and integrity of the Buddha’s teachings requires great care and that significant religious observances such as the higher ordination (Upasampadā) ceremonies play a vital role in sustaining the Dhamma for future generations.
President Disanayake pointed out that certain political groups had exploited nationalism as a tool to regain power. However, he stressed that the true victims of such actions were not the politicians themselves, but the innocent children of parents from both the North and the South. He emphasized the need to reject nationalism and work diligently toward fostering national unity. While affirming that everyone has the right to act freely and democratically, The President emphasized that his administration would not permit nationalism to resurface again. If existing laws are insufficient to suppress it, he stated, they would be strengthened to defeat divisive forces. He reiterated that the goal of his government is to build a society where Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities can live together in peace and harmony.
Addressing the matter of disciplinary discussions within the Sangha, President Disanayake expressed the government’s willingness to facilitate any dialogue, provided that the Mahanayaka Theras can reach a consensus on the matter. Until then, he said, the request to amend Sections 42 and 43 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance has been submitted to the Minister of Buddhasasana and is already under review by the Legal Draftsman’s Department.
Delivering the anusasana, the Most Venerable Aggamahapandita Makulewe Sri Wimala Mahanayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya emphasized that misconduct committed by a very small number of monks is often amplified through social media, resulting in widespread condemnation of the entire Sangha community. The Mahanayake Thera warned that such generalizations have distanced the virtuous public from the Maha Sangha. The Mahanayake Thera further stated that upholding and preserving the Buddhist monastic order is essential and that ceremonies like the Upasampada Vinaya Karma are crucial for nurturing a future generation of well-learned and disciplined monks who can serve both the Sasana and the nation.
This year’s Upasampada Maha Vinaya Karma ceremony of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya is being held from June 30 to July 8, cantered at the Sri Vidyadhara Maha Pirivena in Kalawewa, Kalakarambewa. It is jointly organized by the provincial Sangha Sabhas of the North Central Province and the Upasampada Maha Utsava Committee.
