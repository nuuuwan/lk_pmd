  "article_body_paragraphs": [
    "Following the ten-day \u201cSiri Dalada Vandanawa\u201d religious veneration, a special clean-up operation was carried out at the Kandy Lake by the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Navy.",
    "During this operation, plastic bottles, packaging materials and other waste that had been discarded into the lake were removed, restoring the Kandy Lake to its natural state.",
    "The operation was led by Commander Weerasekara and Captain Charitha Gunawantha of Sri Lanka Navy, with the participation of teams from Clean Sri Lanka, the Department of Irrigation and the Department of Archaeology. The initiative also received strong support from volunteer groups and members of the public.",
    "Kandy Lake has long been a major attraction for both local and international tourists visiting Kandy. However, the accumulation of plastic and other waste materials in the lake poses a serious threat to water sources and aquatic life.",
    "Under the Clean Sri Lanka programme, special attention has been given to protecting the environment, with the aim of fostering an environmental, social and moral awakening within the country and thereby uplifting society to a higher level. A series of initiatives have been launched to cultivate a sense of civic responsibility among the public and to promote the maintenance of a cleaner, waste-free environment.",
    "Accordingly, the Clean Sri Lanka programme was actively implemented across the Kandy city area throughout the past ten days, coinciding with the \u201cSiri Dalada Vandanawa\u201d."
