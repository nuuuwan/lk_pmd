    "The Revenue Administration Reform and Modernization Bureau was established on the instructions of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake with the aim of ensuring the successful implementation of the Customs modernisation initiative. The World Bank delegation commended this step.",
    "The World Bank representatives also expressed their willingness to provide the necessary international institutional support and expert guidance to ensure the success of the programme. In addition, views were exchanged on the revision of the Customs Ordinance.",
