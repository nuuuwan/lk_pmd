First Ceremony to Honour A/L Top Performers Begins Tomorrow in Kilinochchi
A programme to recognise high-achieving students who excelled in the recent 2023/2024 G.C.E. Advanced Level (A/L) examination at district level has been launched by the President’s Fund. The inaugural ceremony will take place tomorrow (22) in Kilinochchi, under the patronage of Speaker Jagath Wickramaratne.
As part of this initiative, 60 outstanding students from each district, demonstrating exceptional merit across all subject streams in the 2023/2024 G.C.E. A/L examination, will be selected to receive financial scholarships and certificates.
The first phase of this province-based programme will be held tomorrow in Kilinochchi. High-achievers from the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya districts who excelled in the 2023 G.C.E. A/L examination will be honoured at the event.
The President’s Fund is currently making arrangements to recognise similarly accomplished students in other districts in due course.
