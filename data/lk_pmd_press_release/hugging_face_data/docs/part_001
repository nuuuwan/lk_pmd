      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the current government\u2019s objective is to drive national development through a structured plan that recognizes economic strengths and brings economic growth to rural areas. He further affirmed his administration\u2019s commitment to lifting rural communities out of poverty during his address at the inauguration of the Vadduvakal Bridge construction project in the Mullaitivu District today (02).",
      "The President noted that a series of new development projects are set to begin across the country this September. He emphasized that the government will put an end to the long-standing practice of delaying projects beyond their deadlines and spending beyond allocated budgets. Instead, all projects will be completed within the scheduled timeframe to ensure their benefits reach the people without delay.",
      "The Vadduvakal Bridge, located near the Nandikadal Lagoon along the Paranthan \u2013 Karachchi \u2013 Mullaitivu road, accommodates more than 3,000 vehicles daily. Due to the lack of maintenance over an extended period, the bridge has become severely unsafe. The Road Development Authority has planned to construct a new two-lane bridge at a cost of Rs. 1.4 billion in public funds, with completion targeted for September 2, 2027.",
      "Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Bimal Rathnayake, speaking at the event, highlighted that although the project was initially estimated at Rs. 1.8 billion, under the current government\u2019s transparent administration it will be completed at a reduced cost of Rs. 1.4 billion. The remaining Rs. 400 million will be allocated for highway development in the Vanni District. He further stated that Rs. 12.5 billion has been allocated for the construction of bridges and highways in the North this year, with provisions expected to increase further in the coming year.",
      "Minister Rathnayake also emphasized that the present government is dedicated to rebuilding the entire country while uniting the North through peace and development. He urged the public to evaluate the current administration based on observable efforts and concrete actions rather than prejudiced ideas.",
      "Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources, Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Deputy Minister of Cooperative Development Upali Samarasingha, Governor of the Northern Province Nagalingam Vethanayahan, Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Senior Professor Kapila C.K.

      "\u201cWe are fulfilling the responsibility of revitalising the North and building a stronger economy for its people\u201d \u2013 President",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasised that the government is committed to revitalising the Northern Province and building a stronger economy for its people.",
      "President Dissanayake noted that during the last Presidential Election, the people of the North placed their trust in the present government and took a step forward and assured that this government would carry that victory into the future. The President further stated that a series of development programmes, including the establishment of industrial zones, will soon be implemented to create new economic opportunities in the North.",
      "He also stressed that the government is dedicated to safeguarding the land rights, linguistic rights and cultural rights of the people in the North, while ensuring their right to know about the missing persons. The President affirmed that the government\u2019s goal is to build national unity within the country and that the necessary decisions and measures will be taken without hesitation to achieve this.",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made these remarks today (2) while attending the inauguration ceremony of the Northern Coconut Triangle in Puthukkudiyiruppu, coinciding with the World Coconut Day celebrations held under the theme \u201cRatama Saru Karai Nirathuru \u2013 Kapthuru Saviya.\u201d",
      "Based on recommendations from the Coconut Research Institute, the Northern Coconut Triangle has been established, covering the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya, by linking the towns of Point Pedro, Silawathura and Kokkilai. Under this initiative, Rs. 500 million was allocated from the previous budget to provide high-yield coconut saplings to cultivators in the North and to develop 16,000 acres of new coconut plantations in 2025.\nOver the three years from 2025 to 2027, the cultivated extent is expected to increase to 40,000 acres. This is aimed at establishing a thriving coconut industry in the Northern Province, uplifting the livelihoods of its people and raising export earnings from coconut-related products by an additional USD 70 million annually.",
      "On this occasion, the President also presented ownership deeds for government assistance to farmers engaged in coconut cultivation across the five districts of the Northern Province.\nThe commemorative magazine prepared for the 2025 World Coconut Day celebrations was officially presented to the President.",
      "Furthermore, Deputy Director General of the International Coconut Community, Mr Nuwan Chinthaka, presented to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake the certificate of recognition awarded to Sri Lanka by the International Coconut Community.",
      "Addressing the ceremony, President Dissanayake said;",
      "We know that the Puthukkudiyiruppu area has in the past been one of the regions most severely affected by conflict. As a result of those battles, the people here lost everything. During the last election, I had the opportunity to meet with the people of this region. It is clear that both the area and its people need to be rejuvenated. In particular, during the last election, the people living in these areas placed their trust in us and took a significant step forward. It is our expectation to carry that trust forward towards success.",
      "To achieve this, we have already begun work in several areas. Firstly, we must ensure the rights of these people. We recognise land rights, language rights, cultural rights and the right to know about their missing loved ones, as their fundamental rights. We have therefore launched a series of measures to safeguard these rights.",
      "Secondly, we must strengthen their economy. As a government, we take responsibility for restoring the economic opportunities they lost and creating a robust economy for them. For this too, we have already taken a number of steps.",
      "Among them are the establishments of new industrial zones in the North, the development of tourism as a sector with fresh potential, the provision of essential facilities such as water for agriculture and as a central initiative, the coconut cultivation project launched today.\nUnder this programme, the Ministry has planned to cultivate 16,000 acres of coconut this year, involving nearly 12,000 farming families. We believe this project will become a strong foundation for uplifting the economy of these people.",
      "Equally important is the unity we must build among ourselves at a cultural level. To this end, we have named a day that can be celebrated by all together. We are also working to strengthen interrelations through sport. We are engaged in a significant effort to reunite people who have long been divided.",
      "For decades, the lives of those here were overshadowed by war. Distrust, suspicion and weapons defined a 30-year-long conflict. That was a great tragedy for our country. It divided our people and gave rise to communal politics.",
      "Both in the North and the South, communalism became the main tool for gaining power. Yet, during the last Presidential Election, the people of this country defeated that trend. We will not allow communal politics to resurface in this country again. Likewise, I believe that you, too, as citizens, must reject such politics.",
      "Our government\u2019s goal is to create unity. We will not hesitate to take any decision necessary to achieve this, even if it may seem difficult. Nor will we allow the regressive, destructive slogans of the past to obstruct the progressive measures we are now taking.",
      "The people of these areas continue to suffer from severe economic hardships. Step by step, we are working to provide solutions to these challenges. Over the past year, we have laid the foundation for this essential work. Today, the political authority has been cleansed of corruption and fraud. We are working to strengthen the public service, to re-establish the rule of law and to increase state revenue. Our aim is to build a strong economy that will enable us to repay our debts.",
      "We are also restarting stalled development projects, as well as launching many new ones. In every sector, we have initiated fresh development.

      "Until now, the people of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu had to travel a long distance to the Vavuniya Regional Office, the only regional office in the Northern Province, to obtain immigration and emigration services. As the number of foreign passport applications from the Northern Province is increasing, this regional office was opened to fulfill the need for a more easily accessible location.",
      "The issuance of three passports by the President symbolised the commencement of providing Department of Immigration and Emigration services to the people of Jaffna.",
      "Subsequently, at a meeting with Jaffna District public officials held at the auditorium of the Jaffna District Secretariat, the President stated that in order to meet the expectations of the people, political authorities and public officials must work together.",
      "The President emphasised that while the government will do its utmost to protect public officials who use their authority for the welfare of the people, it will not hesitate to enforce the law against those who misuse that authority for monetary gain. He further stated that, at present, all public servants in the country have the opportunity to fulfill their duty to the nation.",
      "The President further pointed out that a strong public service is needed to build the country and behind the development of every developed country in the world, there is a strong public service.\nFurther expressing his views, President Anura Kumara Dissanayak said;",
      "\u201cToday, we have established facilities for obtaining services from the Regional Office of the Department of Immigration and Emigration at the Jaffna District Secretariat. Although symbolically it was the issuance of an immigration document, our intervention in this task had a much broader purpose. Our entire administrative structure has been centred in Colombo, compelling people living in distant provinces to travel to Colombo for many services.",
      "The aim of our government is to decentralise this administration to even the most remote rural villages. Facilities must be arranged so that citizens can access government services close to them. By next year, our objective is to enable people to carry out all their transactions with the government through computer software systems and even from their mobile phones. The foremost priority of our government is digitalisation.",
      "At the same time, steps have been taken to strengthen the public service. At the District Committee meeting held at this very place earlier, I announced that we would be granting a salary increase in April. We have done so. By next January, we will ensure that the remaining portion of that increase is also provided. If this country is to be rebuilt, a strong public service is essential. Every developed nation has a robust public service and we too are working to build one in our country.\u201d",
      "Your signature carries great responsibility. If you use it to serve the people, we will give you our fullest protection. But if you use it for financial gain, the law will take its course. We need a State that upholds the rule of law. Unfortunately, our country has become a place where the law has been disregarded and the dignity of public institutions has collapsed. We must restore respect to every state institution and ensure that every public officer regains the honour they deserve. To support this, we will provide the necessary facilities to state institutions.",
      "Our country has reached a point where we must rebuild from the ground up. We have a comprehensive development plan for the Northern Province. For the first time, at the last Presidential and General Elections, the people of the North entrusted their votes to form a government. In a country once divided and mistrustful, people placed confidence in governance. Our duty now is to ensure that this unity is not broken but strengthened, building a nation of togetherness and brotherhood for future generations.",
      "We are aware that certain defeated political forces are attempting to use nationalism as a tool to regain power. This can be seen both in the North and the South. But such nationalist politics serve politicians, not the people. Therefore, all of us whether in the North or the South must reject nationalist politics and ensure it never rises again. We are firmly committed to this.",
      "As a government, we strongly believe there will never be another war in our country. Some try to spread fear that war will return. But our work is to ensure it does not. We must return people\u2019s lands to them, reopen closed roads and eliminate suspicion between communities. I am confident that all of us will work to prevent another war and with that mind-set, we must move our country forward. We must build a new society, leaving behind failed political movements, religious divisions and casteism these belong to the past. Today, what matters is not ethnicity, religion or caste, but humanity. We must place humanity above all divisions and build a country where humanity is the highest value. That is the future of both our country and the world.",
      "I am aware that when we excavate the earth, old skeletons surface. Today, the discovery of mass graves in Chemmani has caused great concern. We are conducting a fully transparent investigation into these. Our goal is to ensure that such mass graves will never be created again in this country.",
      "At this moment, we are fulfilling the most important needs of our nation. Together with our religious leaders, political authorities, state officials and representatives of the security forces, we must work with one purpose. As political leaders, we will fulfill our responsibilities to the fullest. Let us all unite to rebuild this country.",
      "The event was attended by Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala, Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources, Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Deputy Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Sunil Watagala, Deputy Minister of Land and Irrigation Susil Ranasinghe, Members of Parliament, Governor of the Northern Province Nagalingam Vethanayahan, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration Chaminda Pathiraja, Jaffna District Secretary M.Piiratheepan, along with state officials and representatives of the security forces."

      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that during the last Presidential and General Elections, the people of the North took a step forward with the National People\u2019s Power, not just for that single step, but with the vision of moving a thousand steps ahead. The President assured that the trust placed by the people will be safeguarded until a truly united Sri Lankan nation is built.",

      "The President expressed confidence that the first match at the stadium will take place before the end of this year and that within three years, the venue will be ready to host its first international cricket match. He commended and thanked Sri Lanka Cricket for taking this landmark initiative, calling it a turning point for the sport.",

      "The government has decided to launch a special programme called \u2018Seiri Week\u2019under the national initiative Clean Sri Lanka. It will run from September 1 to 4, targeting all state institutions, with the aim of improving efficiency and productivity in the public service.",
      "The main goal of this programme is to create a peaceful, safe and well-organized working environment for public officials. The concept of Seiri, part of the five principles of productivity, refers to identifying what is necessary and eliminating what is unnecessary.",
      "Accordingly, a key focus will be on removing unused items from state institutions and making the best use of limited space.",
      "According to a circular issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government, all Ministries, Departments and state organizations must allocate two hours each morning during this week for cleaning and organizing. Attention will also be given to maintaining clean and attractive buildings and surroundings, improving access roads and ensuring facilities for persons with disabilities.",
      "Guidelines have also been given to properly dispose of unusable inventory items, old motor vehicles and out-dated files.",
      "Crucially, Seiri Week is intended to be an on-going initiative rather than a singular occurrence. All the Heads of the institutions have been directed to implement a lasting framework to maintain the organized environment fostered during this programme, with designated officials tasked with ensuring its persistence."

While the responsibility of adding value rests with entrepreneurs, the President stated that the government intends to introduce a new framework to facilitate this process.",

    "article_title": "National Youth Conference proudly held after 32 years",
    "article_body_paragraphs": [
      "\u2013 President",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that, with the beginning of the new political transformation, the youth movement in the country has transitioned from being a political pawn to a platform that cultivates competent leaders prepared to lead the nation\u2019s future.",
      "The President stressed that the government\u2019s goal is to establish a youth community empowered to shape its own future, ensuring that young people are given their rightful role, rather than merely serving as contributors to the maintenance of political power. He further stated that a programme will be launched through the youth movement to transform young men and women into leaders and stakeholders in the country\u2019s development path.",
      "President Dissanayake made these remarks this morning (12) addressing the \u201cYouth Club\u201d National Youth Conference held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo.",
      "The President highlighted that the future generation should be one that represents Sri Lanka proudly on the global stage and is guided by empathy towards others. He stressed that the government is committed to creating such a qualified generation to take over the country\u2019s future, while calling upon all youth across the nation to strive to become those capable leaders.",
      "This year\u2019s National Youth Conference was notable for being held after a lapse of 32 years, with the participation of over 6,000 young men and women from across the island. In the lead-up to the conference, \u201cYouth Clubs\u201d were established at the regional level throughout the country and during today\u2019s national gathering, the newly appointed officers were officially introduced.",
      "In conjunction with his participation in the National Youth Conference, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was also presented with a commemorative gift.",
      "Addressing the Conference, President Dissanayake further stated:",
      "\u201cI believe this is the most-discussed and most-anticipated youth conference in recent times. Generally, in our country, many sectors have been driven by the desire for political power. Within the youth movement, there has never truly been an opportunity for individuals to progress based on their own talents and aspirations.",
      "When you visited the districts, who were given precedence in taking on political leadership or leading other institutions in your district? Priority was given to the daughters, sons or relatives of the old political leadership. As a result, the youth movement was largely aligned with the political ambitions of those in power. For a long time, this youth movement was developed as a tool to protect their own political influence, maintain family power and keep leadership within their kinship networks.",
      "However, with the new political transformation in the country, this youth movement has evolved beyond being merely a pawn of political ambitions. It has transformed into a movement that nurtures leaders who will take responsibility for the country\u2019s future. This transformation has been clearly reflected throughout our journey up to this National Youth Conference.",
      "It\u2019s no surprise that some feel uneasy. Today, what we are truly doing is empowering our youth by giving them their rightful place and helping build a responsible young leadership that understands how their future should be shaped and what duties they must bear. This is not about creating mere tools to maintain family dynasties or political power for extended periods. There\u2019s talk that the future of the country lies in the hands of its youth. But our true ambition is to make you the real custodians of that future, those who genuinely hold the responsibility for our nation\u2019s path forward.",
      "Specifically, there is one point we want to make clear to you here. Today, we hold positions such as the Presidency, Ministerial offices and Parliamentary seats. However, even as we occupy these roles, we do so with the firm understanding that there will come a day when we will step aside. We have no intention of clinging to these positions indefinitely. We have a very clear and sincere intention. This country was once under the control of a highly destructive group. We have taken over political power from that group. The power we now hold, we do so with the expectation that, in due course, we will pass the baton to you, the next generation. We do not wish to stay in these roles for an extended duration.",
      "Therefore, we must nurture a new generation of young leaders who possess the ability, competence, integrity and conscience to take responsibility for the country. We need to prepare a generation ready to inherit this nation after us. What kind of generation do we need? In today\u2019s fast-paced world, knowledge is rapidly produced, developed and disseminated. Looking back at history, great leaps in knowledge were achieved over long periods of time. However, today, the knowledge we already possess is rapidly generating new knowledge at an unprecedented pace. Moreover, this new knowledge is growing and spreading quickly. The future of the country must not be entrusted to a generation of youth who are unprepared to grasp and harness these vast and rapidly expanding realms of knowledge.",
      "Therefore, our aspiration is to create a new generation for the youth movement, one that rapidly adjusts the fast-growing knowledge of the modern world and quickly adapts to it. We stand firm in the belief that the future of our country must be entrusted to this new generation. Furthermore, compassion and empathy must be inherent within us.",
      "Currently, our education system and way of life have confined our youth within a self-centred shell. Within such a group, genuine empathy towards society is lacking. This is why we need a young generation that truly cares for the broader community. Self-centeredness has frozen and destroyed many valuable qualities in our society, extinguishing much of what is good.",
      "To lead our country forward and achieve meaningful social development, it is essential to build a society rooted in genuine empathy. In this endeavour, the youth movement has been entrusted with a significant role. I firmly believe that you must become citizens who embody empathy and compassion.",
      "Similarly, the innate desire for justice and fairness among the youth must be rejuvenated. Wherever injustice exists, there should be a courageous voice to speak up for justice. For such a voice to be genuine and not merely superficial, one must first become a person who truly values justice and acts with fairness. Unfortunately, a significant portion of our society today is driven by deception, many speak about justice and strive to appear as champions of fairness, but we must honestly reflect on how deeply justice and fairness are actually embraced in their actions.",
      "Raising a voice for justice alone does not transform someone into a just and principled individual. The primary measure of becoming a just citizen lies in how sincerely one upholds justice and acts fairly. Therefore, before you raise your voice for justice and stand for fairness, become a young person with a genuine conscience who truly embodies justice and fairness. We are not entrusting this country to a mere crowd, rather, we are handing over the future of the nation to a new generation that is closely connected to the world and possesses empathy for society. Hence, our mission is to build a youth movement qualified to take responsibility for this country\u2019s future. I urge you to become that qualified young generation.",
      "Today, an issue regarding employment has arisen. Recently, I visited the Maldives, where nearly 30,000 of our young men and women are engaged in jobs. However, these are not government positions. The government there has developed a distinct economy externally. Yet, we have long failed to build an economy that generates employment for skilled and capable people in the informal sector. As a result of this failure, the state itself has become an institution that merely provides jobs. It must not be forgotten that a government should be an institution that creates employment, not just one that supplies jobs.",
      "We all know that the 20th century witnessed major transformations worldwide. Before that century, scientists predicted that states equipped with advanced technology would emerge. Politicians and scholars envisioned the creation of a political world quite different from before, one governed not by monarchies or ruling elites but by governments elected by the people. Similarly, economic experts foresaw the development of new global economic conditions. In this way, what we mostly encountered during the 17th and 18th centuries were only speculative ideas about the future world. These speculations became a reality only in the 20th century.",
      "Due to transformations in technology, science, the marketplace and people\u2019s lifestyles, a vast global market has emerged. However, we have become a nation that has failed to fully grasp and benefit from this market. As a result, an informal economy has not been developed and the government has become the sole institution providing employment.",
      "We need to modernize a government that has become largely stagnant. To this end, Cabinet approval has been granted to recruit nearly 62,000 people into the public service. However, the employment issue cannot be solved merely by this. We must create an open economy through government processes that generates employment opportunities. Plans have already been prepared toward this goal.",
      "We expect that 2.5 million tourists will visit our country this year, and by 2030, this number is anticipated to grow to 4 million. Along with this growth, an economy based on the tourism industry will be established in the open market, and this economy will generate employment opportunities.",
      "We also anticipate that by 2030, the digital economy will grow to reach US $ 15 billion. Our goal is for the digital economy to contribute 12% of the country\u2019s national output. Additionally, we expect a significant transformation through the digitization of agriculture, fisheries and small and medium-scale industries. To achieve this, we need a young generation equipped with knowledge and skills in information technology. This will also create new employment opportunities. Furthermore, we have planned a large-scale economy based on various sectors, including a port-centric economy.",
      "Accordingly, our strategy involves government intervention to build a nation that generates employment.",
      "We aim to create within the country job opportunities that allow our youth to engage in professions they desire, based on their abilities and lifestyles. Moreover, we have successfully established a trusted and stable economy today. Building on this stability, we are ready to embark on the journey of transforming the country into a prosperous state. In this process, the youth bear a great responsibility.",
      "You possess knowledge and enthusiasm. Through this youth movement, we are prepared to launch a programme aimed at empowering you to become the leaders and pillars of this development. You are not excluded from progress, nor are you obstacles to it. Our goal is to establish you as key stakeholders in the development pathway we have designed.",
      "After overcoming a significant and challenging background, you have formed a leadership team. I believe this will enable these young men and women to provide excellent leadership to the country\u2019s youth movement. I wish you success in overcoming the challenges ahead.",
      "This occasion was also graced by the presence of Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, Sunil Kumara Gamage, Deputy Minister of Youth Affairs, Eranga Gunasekara, Deputy Minister of Sports, Sugath Thilakaratne, Members of Parliament, foreign Ambassadors, government officials and invited guests, including Chairman/Director General of the National Youth Services Council Attorney-at-Law Supun Wijerathna."

      "Minister of Science and Technology Prof. Chrishantha Abeysena and a group of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were present at the airport to see her off."

      "Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost indigenous leader, Vishwa Keerthi Vanaspathi Uruwarige Vannila Aththo, initiated the tradition of celebrating World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day in Sri Lanka following his participation in the Indigenous Summit held in Geneva in 1996. Accordingly, the first national celebration of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day in Sri Lanka was held in 1999 at Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo.",

      "The \u2018Sannasa\u2019 (scroll) informing the successful completion of the annual Kandy Esala Maha Perahera of the historic Sri Dalada Maligawa and the Sathara Maha Devala (The Four Chief Shrines) with great pageantry while honouring ancient traditions, was formally presented to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday (09) at the President\u2019s House in Kandy.",

      "To mark the occasion, the President planted a sapling in the premises of the President\u2019s House. Later, in keeping with custom, the President joined the Nilames for a group photograph and also presented gifts and awards to the artists who participated in the Perahera.",
      "Additionally, the President extended financial support to the \u2018Pitisara Devala\u2019 through the \u2018Esala Perahera Trust\u2019 and received the 20th edition of the \u2018Sacred Dalada Culture\u2019 a compilation by the Central Provincial Ministry of Culture.",
      "Addressing the gathering, President Dissanayake said that Sri Lankans are heirs to a great heritage built alongside Buddhist culture one that can never be abandoned, but must be preserved and developed. He noted that the Esala Maha Perahera festival holds a place of utmost importance within this heritage.",
      "The President mentioned that we must reconsider whether we, as a nation, have successfully embraced the new transformation that occurred in the twentieth century, which brought triumphs to the world. The President highlighted that numerous countries, which were previously behind us, surpassed us in the latter part of the twentieth century by swiftly integrating the advancements of that era into their own nations.",
      "The President further stated that we have not succeeded in securing the future of the world and at times, in safeguarding our historical heritage. He emphasized that the challenge and discussion regarding how to select our distinct future and development trajectory confront us today. He emphasized that in discovering our distinct path and shaping the nation\u2019s future, we need to rely on the accomplishments of science and technology, along with our historical legacy.",
      "The President emphasized that the Dalada Perahera is a cultural milestone that should be made even more engaging and brought closer to the people for the benefit of the country\u2019s future. Reflecting on his experience watching the Perahera, the President said he was heartened to see large numbers of enthusiastic youth participating with great energy, as well as both children and elders performing with vigour. President Dissanayake noted, inspires confidence that the nation has a future. \u201cOur goal is to progress as a nation that is linked to these cultural opportunities. Therefore, we need to foster an environment that allows the general public to naturally engage with and understand our historical heritage and culture\u201d, the President said.",
      "The President expressed that the utmost support that can be offered by a political authority to safeguard the nation\u2019s cultural and historical heritage involves detaching politics from the institutional framework, including Devalayas and ensuring they remain the heritage of their historical custodians.",
      "He also mentioned that it is crucial to differentiate between the government sponsorship for these cultural activities and the political agenda.",

      "\u2013 Says the President in Parliament",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that, as a result of the immense sacrifices made by the government over the past year or so, the country\u2019s economy has now reached a stable and strengthened path. He further said that the upcoming budget will ensure the continued flow of economic benefits to the people.",
      "The President said that some individuals are constantly dreaming of an economic collapse in the country, but he emphasised that such a scenario will never materialise. Therefore, he urged them to choose an alternative political path.",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made these remarks in Parliament today (07) while participating in the adjournment debate to discuss the country\u2019s economic situation.",
      "The President appealed to the opposition not to engage in any political activity that would cause instability or economic uncertainty in the country, regardless of their ambitions to come into power. He invited everyone to work together in good faith to lift the country and its people out of their difficulties and create a better standard of living for the citizens.",
      "Following is the full speech delivered by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament:",
      "I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to present a few points regarding the economy during this debate, which is specifically focused on the country\u2019s economic situation.",
      "In recent times, given various international and domestic developments, many hoped the government would collapse. After certain tensions between India and Pakistan, some participants in media discussions even expected bombs to fall on Colombo. But during that conflict, our Defence Secretary and military Commanders were actually in Lahore, Pakistan. The opposition expected a bombing in Colombo.",
      "Later, when an international conflict erupted between Israel and Iran, they again anticipated an opportunity would arise for them. But that too did not happen. Then came their greatest hope, that the country\u2019s economy would collapse due to the new tax policies imposed by the United States. Just two days ago, I saw someone claim that U.S. taxes were rising not just to 30%, but to 44%. That\u2019s merely wishful thinking. They claimed India\u2019s rate would fall by 15\u201320%. The opposition is constantly trapped in a cruel, destructive dream that the country\u2019s economy will fail. But such a collapse will never happen.",
      "I wish to clarify the issue of the U.S. tariff imposed on us. The announcement was made on 2nd of April and came into effect from 9th April. When the United States imposes such a tariff, it is based on a principle. The percentage is set at about half of the trade deficit between the two countries. The trade deficit between the U.S. and Sri Lanka is 88%. So, half of that, 44%, is the basis for the tariff imposed on us. That is how we received a 44% tariff. I noticed the opposition also claimed that this 44% tariff was evidence of the government\u2019s failure. But it is not a government failure; it is a result of the principle adopted by the U.S. when imposing such tariffs.",
      "It must be openly acknowledged that we entered into these negotiations with the United States at a time when we were in a difficult position. We have reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On the other hand, due to the vast differences in population size and economic scale between the United States and Sri Lanka, comparisons and alignment present significant challenges.",
      "Additionally, over 25% of our exports are directed to the United States, which poses a risk of significant impact on our export-driven economy. Nearly 60% of our apparel exports are sent to the United States. Therefore, there exists a risk of direct impact on the livelihoods of nearly 350,000 workers employed in the sector. Hence, we entered into these discussions from a challenging and disadvantaged position. Accordingly, we appointed a highly competent and robust negotiation team.\nAt no stage did we feel the need to have fireworks displays or perform theatrics through the media during each step. However, we were fully aware of the depth and seriousness of this crisis.",
      "Therefore, we continuously engaged in discussions and took the necessary steps forward. Our objective was to conclude these discussions positively and resolve the issue in a manner that would not negatively impact on the country\u2019s economy. We successfully overcame that particular challenge. The United States presented us with a number of proposals during the process.\nWe are still at the discussion level regarding those proposals.",
      "As of now, no final agreement has been reached and no deal has been signed. However, we have reached some levels of consensus in these talks. As a result of the negotiations, we were able to reduce the tariff rate to 20%, which is a notable outcome. We consider this a significant milestone in the mutual understanding reached between both parties. Our negotiation team achieved this success by continuously assessing and discussing the potential impact on local businesses and industries.",
      "This was not a backroom conspiracy hatched by a handful of individuals, but a process of consistent and open dialogue with all relevant stakeholders. Thus, the opposition\u2019s allegations regarding U.S. tariffs will end here. We faced three major external challenges: the U.S. tariffs, the IMF programme and the GSP tax concession scheme.",
      "Various groups have spread misinformation in society regarding the IMF programme. We began negotiations with the IMF on the 16th of November.",
      "We successfully concluded the third review. We managed to defer the implementation of the service tax. We have also properly concluded the fourth review. There was widespread social unrest concerning electricity tariffs. The Ceylon Electricity Board had driven the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and two state banks into a crisis. The funds meant to be provided to those institutions were taken over by the Treasury.",
      "The government has now prepared a clear action plan to safeguard the banks and the Petroleum Corporation. We are of the view that the government must have a presence in both the financial market and the energy market in terms of policy direction. The state\u2019s role must be represented within the financial markets. Prices must be adjusted in line with production costs. We agree with the pricing formula based on this principle. If such adjustments cause hardship to consumers, the government will act to provide relief.",
      "Some state institutions were bankrupt; others had zero balances in their accounts. The electricity tariff was determined after carefully considering all of these factors. However, the Opposition Leader announced the new tariff before the government did. The former government had the opportunity to reduce electricity tariffs in 2024. Yet, they failed to do so. We are continuing to implement programmes in collaboration with the IMF. The GSP tax concessions have provided some relief in accessing European markets. If the economy becomes stable, we can endure the absence of these concessions.",
      "However, as of now, we still require the GSP concessions. Protecting human rights and democracy in our country is a responsibility of the government. In recent times, the only government to have safeguarded democracy and human rights has been the current one.",
      "We have planned to manage the external shocks affecting Sri Lanka in a well-structured manner. The government currently in place has a genuine desire to serve the people. Without creating economic strength, it is not possible to provide relief to the public. The sole challenge faced by this government was to rebuild the collapsed economy. For a whole year, the government has successfully maintained the dollar at around Rs. 300. The opposition expected the dollar to rise to Rs. 400. The black market economy is collapsing. The volatility in the exchange economy is gradually decreasing. Today, no industrialist has uncertainty regarding the dollar. For the first time in Sri Lanka\u2019s history, the dollar has remained stable for a year.",
      "When examining Sri Lanka\u2019s export income data from 2015 to 2025, it is evident that the highest-ever export earnings were recorded in the first six months of this year. The export market has been diversified. Of our total exports, 25% go to the United States and 23% to the European Union. Therefore, any tariffs imposed by these countries have a significant impact on Sri Lanka. This is why the government has planned to further diversify exports.",
      "We do not intend to rely solely on two or three powerful countries or a few export markets in the future. Comparing June last year with June this year, exports to the African market have grown by 57%. Looking at the Asian market, export activity has expanded by 26% compared to the previous year.",
      "We are providing the necessary infrastructure for industrialists. In return, they must pay taxes to the government appropriately. When looking at the tourism sector, this year\u2019s revenue has increased by 10% compared to last year. Therefore, 2025 will become the year with the highest export income and the highest tourism revenue in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. We believe that certain incentives must be provided to encourage foreign direct investment.",
      "This year is becoming the year with the highest foreign investment. We need foreign direct investment (FDI). However, we are not a country with vast raw materials or a large market. Attracting FDI requires overcoming major difficulties. Therefore, some incentives must be provided for FDI. In the first six months of last year, FDI amounted to USD 252 million. In the same period this year, it has reached USD 507 million, which is a 101% increase. We expect to earn over USD 1 billion in FDI this year.",
      "The Colombo city development project must proceed. Approval has been granted for USD 1,313 million in FDI for this purpose. We must plan accordingly and channel these funds towards development. We bear the burden of past destruction, but we have the opportunity to lead the country towards prosperity.",
      "By this December, we will have foreign reserves of USD 7 billion. After five years, we have reopened the vehicle market. As of today, letters of credit worth USD 1,268 million have been opened. Our country has vehicles that are 15 to 20 years old, which can no longer run on the roads. The vehicle sector itself is an industry and must be linked to the national economy. By this December, we expect letters of credit to be opened amounting to USD 1,500\u20131,800 million.",
      "However, there are conspiracies to create pressure on the dollar. Rumours are being spread that vehicle imports will be halted. We wish to assure our citizens that vehicle imports will not be restricted. The open market will continue to operate in its current form.",
      "If you cannot buy a vehicle this year, you can buy one next year. Do not engage in actions that harm the country\u2019s economy. There are claims that taxes will be increased, we assure you that taxes on vehicles will not be raised. A country cannot progress by shutting down industrial opportunities. Our aim is to ensure the free movement necessary for the economy. Doubts being raised about our dollar reserves are baseless.",
      "Similarly, domestic investments through the Board of Investment have increased. Compared to last year, domestic investments have grown by 18% this year. This leads to job creation and enhanced economic growth.",
      "This year has shown signs of becoming the best year for dollar inflows, direct foreign investments, tourism sector and export earnings. When presenting the budget document, we anticipated revenue of approximately Rs. 4.5 trillion. Many said this revenue target was unattainable. They claimed the government was creating an illusion using numbers.",
      "The Inland Revenue Department, Customs and the Excise Department have been effectively restructured, increasing their efficiency and working to recover taxes from those evading payment. A list of 200 major tax defaulters has been compiled, with the total value estimated at 100\u2013150 billion. These amounts must be recovered. Is that wrong? There are groups who have defrauded state banks, including politicians and businessmen. We have ensured transparency and independence within the banks.",
      "On the revenue side, we have reached a stable and strong level. All sectors have exceeded their revenue targets. We are capable of generating 4.5 trillion in revenue. By July, the Inland Revenue Department surpassed its target by 101%, the Customs Department by 115% and the Excise Department exceeded its Rs. 136 billion target, reaching Rs. 143 billion. During the first seven months, all three major sources of tax revenue have surpassed the goals we set. Therefore, revenue generation for the government is not a concern.",
      "There is a crisis in the sugar industry. Production costs are high, there are too many workers and the industry has not been modernised. Due to various reasons, the price of sugarcane was increased three times, resulting in higher costs to produce a kilo of sugar. So what should we do now? Either sell below production cost and let the treasury absorb the loss, or impose taxes on imported sugar to stabilise the price. Are we now willing to impose such taxes? At the very least, a tax of Rs. 50 must be charged. No one should insist on removing taxes from specific sectors. Taxes will be collected from all sectors, while subsidies will be given where appropriate. The government is granting Rs. 1 billion to sugar companies. Reducing taxes serves no purpose if no taxes are paid and salaries are not paid. This issue will be resolved starting this week. We are operating under a rebuilding plan.",
      "Today, the government has Rs. 1,000 billion. If treasury bonds are issued, we are the primary buyer. In the past, artificial conditions were created. Today, we can no longer afford such manipulation. We are regulating the market and stopping distortions. Isn\u2019t that how a country should be governed?\nWhen we reflect on the indicators used to assess whether the economy is good or bad, we can see that we have managed to bring the country to a stable position. If the opposition believes the country will collapse due to an economic breakdown that will not happen. In recent times, the economy collapsed due to economic pressure. Then, governments fell due to political crises. People came to the streets and overthrew governments. Some fell through elections. Let it be clear: this government will not fall through any of those means.",
      "No one should believe that the power of their own network or circle makes them immune to the law. Yet, such a mindset exists in this country. In a nation where some citizens cannot access justice, even those who can often refuse to submit to the law. Therefore, if we are to rebuild the country, we must once again establish the supremacy of the rule of law.",
      "When the rule of law is enforced, the law will reach even those who once believed they were untouchable behind their powerful networks. We have extended our full support to the Criminal Investigation Department and provided the necessary resources and authority to the Bribery or Corruption Commission. They have been empowered to carry out their duties and the law is now actively pursuing criminals.",
      "A court order has been issued to arrest a former Navy Commander. However, some are now holding media briefings and claiming that these actions are meant to appease the LTTE diaspora. Let me be clear we have no intention of appeasing anyone. We seek to serve and bring justice to the citizens of this country. Today, criminals are aware that the law is behind them. When a Personal Secretary is summoned to testify, they know exactly what is happening. Before the law reaches them, some attempt to create instability in the country a pattern we\u2019ve seen in the past. This leads to intimidation of law enforcement officers. There have been times in history when officials were even imprisoned for simply conducting fair investigations. There are efforts underway to instil fear among officials.",
      "However, we have empowered our officials with the leadership, courage and authority they need. Moreover, we are fully committed to protecting them whenever necessary. Whether we are in government or outside of it, we will stand by every official who is dedicated to upholding the law in this country. Even if we are not in power, as responsible citizens, we assure you that we will continue to protect those officials committed to justice and integrity.",
      "I say to the Opposition if you believe this government is unnecessary, then present a programme that shows you are needed. In that case, there is a path forward a conversation we are willing to have. If you believe we are not doing enough for the development of this country, then present your reasoning. We are doing what needs to be done in this moment. If there\u2019s more that should be done, tell us what that is. We inherited a country that had come to a standstill. Many development projects funded by foreign assistance had been suspended. However, today we have revived the economy. For example, the Mirigama\u2013Kadawatha expressway project was originally funded by China\u2019s EXIM Bank. The loan amount granted back then is no longer sufficient a larger loan is now needed.",
      "Therefore, discussions must be held to revise the funding. I\u2019m pleased to announce that the EXIM Bank of China has agreed to provide a new loan in Yuan at highly concessional interest rates. We will present this to the Cabinet on Monday, and once approved, work on the expressway can commence.",
      "This year, we will begin work on several major projects including the Katunayake Airport and the Kadawatha\u2013Mirigama expressway. We are also making maximum efforts to secure foreign funding for the construction of the Galagedara\u2013Kandy expressway. If those efforts are unsuccessful, we will begin construction next year using domestic funds.",
      "Furthermore, we must swiftly move forward with renewable energy projects. We are actively initiating such projects. We are also working to expand the capacity of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Six new oil storage tanks are being built in Kolonnawa. Additionally, the long-delayed rehabilitation of the Trincomalee oil tank farm has now commenced.",
      "Stabilizing the energy sector is critically important. Due to the failure to manage past deals by previous leaders, citizens are now paying significantly higher prices for energy. We have now called for tenders to address this.",
      "For nearly a year, we have worked tirelessly to stabilize the core fundamentals of this country\u2019s economy. Our financial markets must never again fall into uncertainty. As leaders, we all carry the responsibility of ensuring that. The people of our country must never face a second round of this kind of economic crisis. To avoid this, it is essential to establish a robust and resilient economy from the foundation onward.",
      "We need a country where the rule of law is firmly established. Engage in politics as you wish but never even dream of weakening the enforcement of justice against the corrupt. I urge everyone to support the actions necessary to hold wrongdoers accountable. We have begun the effort to rebuild and restore this country. We are not a group who entered politics for personal gain or ambition. Today, for the first time, both local and international investors, industrialists and entrepreneurs know that Sri Lanka\u2019s political authority is not engaging in theft.",
      "This is crucial for investment and equally important for building a strong and respected presence on the global stage through sound diplomatic relations. Once, at the United Nations Human Rights Council, our country was perceived in a negative light. For the sake of future generations, we must clean this nation. We must turn this country into a place where our children can live with pride.",
      "To do that, the first step is to establish the supremacy of the law. The second is to ensure economic prosperity. The third, we must dismantle the criminal underworld that lurks beneath our society. We know that the underworld, narcotics trade and organized crime are all interconnected and we are confronting them head-on. But we ask for a little more time. This crisis must be overcome. In doing so, we must act with patience and well-thought-out planning.",
      "We have laid out plans to rebuild this nation to uplift the economy, ensure a better quality of life for our citizens, create a brighter future for our children, provide high-quality healthcare and develop a modern transportation system. We are rebuilding a nation that was once brought to its knees. That is why we are moving forward with this programme in a stable and determined manner. Let no one even consider trying to obstruct this journey. Do not forget the law stands firm.",
      "As we prepare the upcoming budget, we are engaging in consultations with all sectors of society. We are doing our utmost to find solutions to their concerns. This country must transform into an enlightened state once again. For that, we are working with unwavering commitment.",
      "You are free to engage in politics but if anyone tries to create chaos in the country as a means to evade justice, we will not allow it. If any group, from anywhere whether underworld elements or defeated factions attempts to engage in political conspiracies, we will not allow those plots to derail this journey toward rebuilding our nation.",
      "If the current legal framework is insufficient, we will create the necessary laws. This country must be rebuilt. No one should drag the nation into turmoil simply because they lost their privileges or fear the consequences of justice. Previous governments may have fallen victim to such conspiracies.",
      "However, we have already identified these actions. Therefore, if anyone whether, within or outside the state attempts to sabotage the journey to rebuild this country through conspiratorial means, we will take every possible step to defeat such efforts. Today, various distorted claims are being made.",
      "But we recognize both the sound at the door and the beating of the drum, we can distinguish truth from deception. So if anyone is even contemplating conspiracy, we will not allow it. You may continue with your politics. But we have now brought the country to a much better path. We are rescuing both the nation and its people from disgrace and hardship. That is our determination and we are working toward it. We request sincere support from the opposition for this cause.",
      "A challenge has arisen regarding district development and I assure you, we will address it next. The allocations were genuinely made for the districts. Each Member of Parliament was expected to submit a sufficient number of proposals aligned with the allocated funds for their respective district. When we presented the budget, our expectation was that all MPs would receive their respective allocations. Once the funds were allocated to a district, corresponding proposals were expected from every MP within that district. However, I have received reports that this process has broken down in some areas. I give you my assurance that such lapses will not be allowed in the next year.",
      "We tabled the budget document on March 21st. Shortly after that, the provincial council elections were called and those concluded on May 6th. During that period, the Election Commission imposed restrictions, which delayed implementation of some of the proposed projects. Therefore, the real work could only begin after May 6th. That left a limited window, especially since all projects must be completed by December 31st. As a result, some MPs may have missed opportunities to submit their proposals in time.",
      "In our system, activities commence only after funds are allocated to the relevant Ministries. But all funds allocated under the 2025 budget will be fully disbursed. We now have the capacity to release those funds. Some delays have occurred in implementation, but moving forward, claims of budgeted funds being withheld will not arise. From 2026 onward, funds will be available starting in January, immediately after the budget is approved. This will ensure early commencement of projects.",
      "We do not engage in the kind of politics where funds are withheld from certain individuals. Every Member of Parliament will receive the funds allocated to them. Moreover, in the upcoming budget, we also expect to provide a concessionary vehicle on a returnable basis for use during their term of office.",
      "We have laid a very strong foundation for a positive journey, and this is the path we are committed to follow. You are free to represent a different political party and work toward gaining power that is perfectly acceptable. However, I urge you not to engage in conspiracies, not to create instability in the country and not to generate uncertainty about the economy. I request this from everyone."

      "\u2013 President says addressing the 41st Annual Convention of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that next year\u2019s budget allocations will be set aside to build a modern public service, following a self-critique of the state, which he described as being in a state of physical and spiritual ruin.\nPresident Dissanayake further stated that the public service must be brought into a culture of modernity and that all possible measures will be taken to protect it.\nThe President said that priority attention has been given in next year\u2019s budget to improving the physical facilities of the public service in order to modernise the state, which he described as being in ruins.\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake expressed these views while attending yesterday\u2019s (05) 41st Annual Convention of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SASA) at Temple Trees as the Chief Guest.\nThe 41st Annual Convention of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association was held at Temple Trees today (05), with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the chief guest and in the presence of Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government, Dr.  Chandana Abayarathna.\nThe Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association is a professional body composed of officers of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, which is the leading island-wide service in the public sector. It is noteworthy that this year\u2019s annual convention was held after a five year hiatus.\nThe President explained that to strengthen the public service, a salary increase proposed in the last budget would be continued, with Rs. 110 Billion allocated for a salary increase next year. He added that the government also plans to allocate Rs. 110 Billion for public service salary increases in 2027.\nThe President stated that the government, as the political authority, is committed to creating an attractive public service and expects the dedication of public administration officials in this endeavour.\nPresident Dissanayake said that for a minority in the public service, their assigned responsibilities has become a transaction and that the public service, which prioritised financial values over social values, must be salvaged from this situation.",
      "The President said that the responsibility of public officials towards citizens cannot be confined by circulars or statutes. He added that officials who prioritise social values and social core systems must be created and that the responsibility of public officials is not to oppress others but to use their power to build a good public service and provide the public with a better life.\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the public service has now reached a crossroads and that it is still possible to move forward over time. However, he said that the time has come to evaluate our responsibilities and choose the path necessary to provide an efficient service based on the needs of the citizen.\nThe President said that new experiments should be carried out as required for a new transformative change to create the country that citizens desire and that efforts should be made to restore the ruined state.\nFollowing is the full speech by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake:\n\u201cThis is a special occasion. I have met many of you here on various occasions. There are people who studied with me at university and others who were involved in different social activities with me. So, we have met at various times while working in different fields. However, this meeting is more important than all the others. Because you, who are participating in this annual convention of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, one of the foremost services in our public sector and you are a group of people who bear great effort and responsibility for the maintenance of our state. Therefore, I am very happy to have a discussion like this with you.\nAt the beginning of this event, a video presentation was made about the history and development of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. Our administrative service has a long history. Even if you take the period after independence, our political sphere has a long history. As a result, our public service and the political machinery have jointly guided this country for a long time.\nHowever, if we look at the current state of our country, can the political authority and the connected state body be happy with where our country is? We have passed various laws and statutes. We have granted various powers. We have caused various political upheavals. We have changed various titles. But if we look back, I don\u2019t think any of us, if we honestly ask ourselves, can be satisfied with the state of the public service. Putting our own measurement aside, go and ask the average citizen if they are satisfied. They are not satisfied. That\u2019s why your convention is taking place at a very important juncture. At this juncture, we have two paths we can choose from.\nOne is the old, mundane path of simply letting time pass, fulfilling the duties assigned to us only as they arise. It is the path our country has travelled for a long time. It is a very easy path.",
      "But there is another path: for each of us to commit to change by honestly evaluating how effectively our role has contributed to building the state and improving people\u2019s lives. This path is not easy, because it is human nature to become comfortable with routine. People often fear change and experimentation. When we continue to perform our daily tasks in the same way, we get used to that routine and learn to manage our responsibilities within that comfort zone.\nHowever, if we choose a new path and are ready to embrace change, we will be challenged by the power of habit. Habit tends to resist transformation and slow down progress. Yet, when we look at the achievements and advancements of human civilization, one thing becomes clear: the key to that progress has been the courage to experiment without fear.\nAdapting to new situations is extremely important. If you fail to adapt, society will leave you behind. That\u2019s why my first request to you is this: be willing to embrace change. Any living being or idea that cannot adjust to new circumstances will soon become irrelevant or disappear. So once again, I urge you to be prepared to adapt.\nHowever, what I\u2019m asking you to do is to adapt to a new situation within a state that is already in ruins. Our state is broken, both physically and spiritually. That is the reality we face. If we are unwilling to confront this harsh truth and instead choose to look away as if we\u2019re merely passing a cemetery, then true transformation will never be possible.\nTherefore, first of all, we need to understand the nature and the truth of the harsh reality that lies before us. We need to be open. We need to bring it to the table for discussion. What is the reality before us? I know that the official vehicles given to the officials here today are old, dilapidated vehicles that are more than 15-16 years old. The computers on your tables are old and in ruins. As a result, the state is physically in ruins. Therefore, we cannot create a modern state from a ruined public service. That is why we will pay special attention in this year\u2019s budget to allocating the necessary funds to provide the facilities and support needed to modernise the public service.\nWe must move swiftly toward digitization, it is the most important transformation in the next phase. However, the power of habit is an obstacle. I\u2019m aware that some institutions have already developed software systems and we acknowledge and appreciate that progress. That\u2019s a good start. At a meeting with District Secretaries, one Secretary shared how she had successfully digitised her office. This was possible because there were officials within that office who supported the change. In other words, it happened due to the personal commitment of the people involved, not as part of a broader, systemic transformation. This is a clear example of how habit continues to resist change.\nNevertheless, we all share a common and sincere goal: to modernise our public service. As part of that effort, we have granted you the highest basic salary increase in recent history.",
      "To pay for this salary increase, Rs. 110 Billion is needed this year. In January next year, you will receive another salary increase, which also requires Rs. 110 Billion. A salary increase in 2027 will also require another Rs. 110 Billion. Therefore, to pay for these increased salaries, we will have to bear a cost of Rs. 330 Billion. This is in addition to the salary you are currently being paid. We have to allocate it from the 2027 budget. In this year\u2019s budget, we allocated Rs. 110 Billion. In next year\u2019s budget, it will become Rs. 220 Billion. By 2027, to pay for this total salary increase, we will have to bear a cost of Rs. 330 Billion. We know that in order to make our public service an attractive place, a fair salary scale must be established. We have done that. We have taken steps to provide an 80% salary increase.\nHowever, in certain areas of the state apparatus, we do not see officials taking responsibility for their duties. There have been instances where officials were found keeping money in their lockers. These are issues of ethics and morality. Prisoners have handcuffs and even keys in their possession. What is the root of this problem? A sense of responsibility and social values has been replaced by monetary value. All traces of humanity have been drowned and destroyed in a sea of ice. These are not matters that can be resolved through circulars, directives, or even the constitution. They must be understood as personal responsibilities and social obligations of every citizen.\nIf we are to create a modern public service, we must create a public service with a new spirit, as well as the objectives I mentioned above. Our public service needs a new system of values and principles. We must also recognise the true meaning of values. Values are not about over-consumption or triumphing by oppressing others. Society needs a new core system of values to replace these wrong values and principles. Gentleness, compassion and accountability for one\u2019s assigned responsibilities are all necessary. We are all citizens. And we have all been assigned responsibilities in our respective fields. We must understand that not a single one of those responsibilities should be used to oppress others. The citizens of our country are looking at all of us with a plea. They are looking with pleading eyes to see if you will save our country and our citizens from the current situation. We have no right to ignore this at this time.\nIf you and we do not make this transformation, the citizens of our country will not even dream of a new world and good things. Therefore, we have a role to play in creating these good things.\nThere have been some criticisms and comments regarding certain investigations, but no one should fear this. We understand that officials may have past records and that there are things people have heard or know about one another. However, we are not judging you based on old perceptions or past reputations. Those are not relevant to us.\nWhat matters to us is how you have conducted yourself from the moment you were given your current responsibilities. Past actions will be investigated where necessary. We know that you sign thousands of documents every day. But if that signature that is meant to serve a social purpose, has been misused for personal financial gain, we will take legal action. This must not be seen as a witch hunt against the public service, nor as an attempt to intimidate officials. We have no such agenda.",
      "I noticed that a former President recently remarked that the Bribery Commission should be left alone and that no one should interfere or comment on its work. There seems to be a hope that the public will rise up against the Commission\u2019s actions. Some believe this is the path to the government\u2019s downfall. They assume that when the law is enforced, certain individuals will become angry and that this wave of discontent will topple the government.\nBut what does this really mean? It means that the rule of law is being restored. And I would like to ask: is reintroducing proper limits and accountability within the public service truly a reason to bring down a government?\nWe must create a new culture within the public service of this country ourselves. Our goal should be to provide a service that truly satisfies the citizens. Take a moment to find out how many people who visit your office on a Wednesday are repeat visitors and ask why that is.\nLet\u2019s commit fully to transforming our public service into this new culture. You have my full support in this endeavour. Let us become the guardians of every decision made with this purpose in mind. We are not hunters seeking to punish, but rather, we are working to restore our country.\nThis is an effort no one should fear, instead, it should be welcomed and supported. I believe you will stand with me in this important task.\nWe have both the desire and the challenge to lead this country towards a new transformation. If you ask yourself whether you can be proud of this country, it means your heart holds a sincere intention to create a better future for our nation and its people. However, there is currently a gap between these good intentions and our actions. It\u2019s time to begin acting according to your true conscience. Listen to that inner voice. This important work can only succeed if both the political leadership and the public sector work together with a shared purpose.\nWe, as the political authority and you, as the public service, have a responsibility. We will not change that in any way. Let\u2019s perform our duties for a single purpose.\nThere have been many discussions about a common purpose on various occasions and groups of colleagues have worked together as friends. I now call on everyone to unite and make this transformation a reality.\nI wish your convention every success and invite everyone to come together to build a strong public service that provides the people with the facilities they need for a better life.",
      "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya:\nFor a long time, the value and dignity of the public administrative service in our country have been somewhat diminished. Political interference has also played a role in this decline. As a result, public trust in the public administrative service has been eroded. We must reconsider how to restore that trust in a service with such a long and proud history. As the political authority, we are committed to intervening in order to establish governance that is truly centred on the people.\nThe political authority will do everything possible to transform the vital work you do into a service centred on the people. Your contribution is essential to making this transformative change a reality. We will neither ask you to act improperly in the public service nor tolerate such behaviour. It is within this foundation of trust that real transformation can take place in our country.We ask you to carry out your duties grounded in that trust. We believe this trust will empower you to effectively implement the policies designed for the benefit of the nation.\nDr. Hans Wijayasuriya, Chief Advisor to the President on Digital Economy:\nWith the power of digitisation in the public service, citizens can receive more efficient and timely services. To progress as a country with capabilities on an international level, digitisation is essential for our public administrative service. Just as Sri Lankan cricket and our rich history have earned a special place in the world, the public service too can gain global recognition through digitisation. Therefore, we must not miss this important opportunity.\nThe role played by the public administrative service in helping the country recover swiftly from the previous economic crisis was crucial. The international community, observing Sri Lanka during that difficult time, doubted that such a rapid recovery was possible. Yet, the Sri Lankan public administrative service rose to the challenge and carried that great responsibility.\nWith the addition of digitisation, it will become even more achievable to elevate Sri Lanka onto the global stage. Digitisation has the ability to create a world-class system of governance. Therefore, this opportunity should be seized without hesitation.\nMeanwhile, a research journal prepared by the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association was also presented to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.\nMinisters, Governors, Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development, Thilaka Jayasundara, Ministry Secretaries and officials and members of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association, including the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government Dr.  Chandana Abayarathna, were among those who attended the event."

As a result, many professional singers have experienced unfair treatment. The Singers Association has urged the President to establish an Independent Committee to review these matters and propose the required legal amendments.\nThe President pointed out that this issue has persisted for a long time. He stated that a solution should be sought by studying existing international law and conventions built on technological needs, while also taking into account the facts presented by all parties mentioned above, to ensure fairness for everyone.",

      "\u2013 President says Addressing Sri Lankan Community in Maldives",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasised that his government will honour the trust placed in them by all Sri Lankan people and fulfil the responsibility of building the prosperous nation they envision.\nThe President made these remarks yesterday (30) afternoon while addressing the Sri Lankan community residing in the Maldives at the Maldives National University (MNU) Auditorium.\nThe gathering, organised by the Sri Lankan High Commission in the Maldives, brought together Sri Lankan professionals, students and individuals working in various fields in the country.\nThe President pointed out that the government has prioritised establishing a new political culture and reviving the economy, which were key aspirations of the mandate received in the last presidential election. He stated that a new political culture has been created in the country, replacing the corrupt political system and that the current government has taken steps to breathe new life into the stagnant economy. The President also mentioned that the rule of law is now actively enforced across the country, applying equally to everyone.\nThe President urged everyone to \u201cwork together to build a better country for future generations, ensuring they do not inherit the hardships faced by the current generation and to create a future full of hope and aspirations.\u201d He also thanked all Sri Lankans residing in the Maldives who dedicated themselves to the victory of the National People\u2019s Power government in the last Presidential and General Elections.\nFurthermore, the President answered questions raised by the community concerning the current situation in Sri Lanka and issues faced by the Sri Lankan expatriate in the Maldives.\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake, addressing the Sri Lankan community in the Maldives, further stated:",
      "\u201cDuring the last presidential election, we met with Sri Lankans abroad. The Maldives has become the first country where I, as President, have addressed the expatriate Sri Lankan community. I believe many of you here wished to see our country become a very developed nation and for its people to achieve a higher standard of living.\nIt\u2019s not enough for each of us to have individual assessments of our country. To make it a reality, we had to gain political power. In the last presidential and general elections, with the support of all of you, we received the political change and power needed to transform our country for the better. Just as I stated before you then, we will not allow the trust you placed in us to waver even slightly. Why did the people choose us for a new political change?",
      "Back then, our country had one law for the rich and powerful and another for the poor and vulnerable. Therefore, the people desired the re-establishment of the supremacy of the rule of law in the country. Additionally, our country had an ugly political culture where the political authority enjoyed privileged positions, acting above citizens rather than engaging with them. So, the people wanted to end this ugly political culture and build a new, more accessible political culture. There was also a desire to eliminate the rampant fraud, corruption, bribery and waste that permeated our entire state machinery.\nFurthermore, due to the highly unsuccessful and flawed economic policies pursued by our state for a long time, our country had become largely economically bankrupt and the people of this country had hoped for an economic revival. The people gave us power hoping for a new transformation in these and many other areas. The people of this country, marking a profoundly significant political leap in world history, elevated us to the highest political position. A political movement that received 3% in the previous election achieved an exceptional victory in the subsequent general election, electing the highest number of MPs in Sri Lankan history to Parliament.\nEvery one of you contributed to that political transformation. That\u2019s why today I am the President, our Cabinet is formed and a significant power block has been created in Parliament,  it is all thanks to the contribution given by the people of our country, including yourselves. This power was not created by wealth, nor by media influence, nor by any inherited power. This power was not created on the basis of our family lineage or background. This entire power was created by the people of the country. Therefore, as President and as the Cabinet, we have an undeniable, inalienable responsibility. We will protect the trust you have placed in us.\nI know there\u2019s a lot of noise out there. All of that is an expression of defeat, uncertainty about power and political failure, not reality. The reality is that we are slowly but steadily building our country. We will free our country and its people from the challenges they face.\nIt was your expectation to see a very strong rule of law implemented in our country. How was the law enforced in our country back then? Power bent the law. The law was trampled upon. Rulers believed they should be above the law. But today, we are happy to say that the supremacy of the rule of law has been established, irrespective of status. We have no personal desire for revenge against anyone. However, we have a sincere desire that citizens must be subject to the law. Power, wealth, or position are not the criteria that determine whether one is subject to the law or not.\nOur country needs a new political culture. Everyone must be equal before the law. And everyone is subject to the law. Everyone should fear the law. There was an era in our country when people did not fear the law. We must gradually transform our country into a society where citizens are subject to the law and show some fear of it. People should be afraid to engage in fraud or accept bribes. Yet, amassing great wealth became a tool for being above the law. An era was created where state property and public funds were wasted on a grand scale. We are building a state where everyone is equal before the law. We will make Sri Lanka a country where people are not only afraid to take bribes but even to think about taking one.",
      "You know, the head of the prison has been arrested. Officials from the Department of Motor Traffic and Customs have been arrested. The Inspector General of Police is under arrest. A large number of former police officers have been suspended. A former Navy Commander has also been arrested. All these individuals were above the law and manipulated it as they wished. Today, we are enforcing the law without regard for rank or status. We are doing this to uphold the supremacy of the rule of law, which was a key expectation of the mandate the people gave us.\nThe fraud and corruption that plagued our country\u2019s political authority must be eradicated. I can give you one guarantee: for the first time, we have established a government that will not steal a single cent of public money. We have completely stopped the bribery, corruption and waste that enveloped the political authority. However, there\u2019s a state mechanism that runs on habit. I know there are people who don\u2019t pay taxes to the Inland Revenue Department. We have a list of those who portray themselves as very wealthy, luxurious businessmen but have defaulted on payments to state banks.\nThere was a tendency to commit fraud and corruption, evading taxes owed to the government. The banking system, which was eager to auction off the properties of good individuals, provided protection to those with political patronage. Therefore, the people of our country had a desire to stop fraud and corruption. This has now been achieved within the political authority and we will do the rest.\nFurthermore, the people of this country wanted to see those who committed fraud and corruption punished. Punishing the corrupt is not, personally speaking, the President\u2019s task. Laws are needed to punish the corrupt. We have a very strong law, the Public Property Act. If public funds exceeding Rs. 25,000 are misappropriated, there is no bail.\nUnder the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, if one cannot show how wealth was acquired, that wealth can be confiscated. Additionally, a law for the confiscation of illegally acquired property was passed in Parliament on April 8th.\nTherefore, the necessary laws to combat bribery and corruption have been enacted. We also need to activate the institutions for this purpose. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption has been provided with the necessary legislation. The necessary institutions have been established and buildings have been provided for them to operate their offices. We are also planning to place the officials of the Bribery or Corruption Commission on a higher salary scale very soon. In this way, we are providing the necessary facilities. We have made the necessary changes and provided facilities to the Criminal Investigation Department and the Attorney General\u2019s Department.\nChanging this ugly political culture in our country was a major goal of the people. Today, we are changing that culture. As President, I have a responsibility. Similarly, as the Cabinet, as state officials, as ambassadors, everyone has a responsibility. We are obliged to fulfil these responsibilities. In the past, the political authority was above all this. And sometimes, the people of our country even expected such a thing. But today, we are all striving to fulfil the responsibilities entrusted to us. Therefore, instead of the political culture that existed in our country, where politicians were above the public, we have taken steps towards a new political culture that integrates\nthe political authority, the state machinery and the public, shoulder to shoulder, for this transformation.",
      "Another primary expectation of the people was to strengthen the country\u2019s economy. If the economy is not strong, it\u2019s difficult to establish the rule of law, a good culture, or a state with reduced crime. Therefore, our biggest challenge was to create a strong economy. We were a bankrupt country two or three years ago. Even a hundred years from now, if the economic history of Sri Lanka is written, 2022-2023 will have a separate chapter dedicated to it. It is something that can never be erased from the country\u2019s economic history.\nWith our country becoming bankrupt, trust in the financial system began to collapse. As a result of bankruptcy, investments stopped coming into Sri Lanka. All ongoing projects came to a halt. Inflation reached nearly 70%. Trust in the dollar completely began to crumble. Bank interest rates increased dramatically. A situation was created where no one would start a new business. It became impossible to import medicines, gas and fuel. As a country and a society, we faced the consequences of the economic policies pursued for a long time. The victims of this economic problem were by no means those who were involved in those decisions.\nWe didn\u2019t inherit a country that was running well. We inherited a country that was grinding to a halt. Our initial step was to figure out how to revive this stagnant state. When we took over the government, debt restructuring discussions had already begun. We concluded the debt restructuring programme on December 21st last year. This is the biggest turning point in this economic transformation.\nSince 2022, we had become a country that did not repay its debts. However, on December 21st, 2024, we reached an agreement with the lending countries that we would start repaying debts from 2028. Now we are officially free from bankruptcy. Accordingly, agreements have been made to gradually restart stalled projects. Especially, all development projects provided to our country by China, India and Japan will largely recommence before the end of this year. This is the first step in a country that had come to a standstill.\nWe also need dollars. We are very happy to say that there are three main factors contributing to us receiving dollars. The first group is you, the expatriate Sri Lankans. We would like to say that this year will be the year with the highest dollar remittances from overseas Sri Lankans. The second source of dollars for the country is tourism. This year will be the year with the highest number of tourist arrivals and the highest dollar earnings from tourism in Sri Lankan history.\nThe third source is export revenue. Regarding export revenue, 2025 will be the year with the highest export earnings in Sri Lanka. In this way, a very strong stability has been created in the economy. As a result, we have managed to maintain the dollar\u2019s value around the 300 rupee mark for nearly a year now.\nFor five years, vehicle imports in our country were stopped. We have opened up the vehicle market. As of yesterday, we have opened LCs worth USD 1200 million for vehicle imports. However, the dollar remains stable. This reflects a very important characteristic of the economy.",
      "Foreign direct investment is also a very important part of the economy. This year, so far, USD 563 million in foreign direct investment has come through the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka. This is a 101% increase compared to last year. Especially in Port City, we have approved four new projects. In addition to foreign direct investment, a large amount of investment has also been received by the Port City.\nSimilarly, bank interest rates are also a crucial factor. Bank interest rates had risen to 30%-35%. This was a very bad situation. No one would take a loan at such an interest rate to run a business. Therefore, money flowed into fixed deposits, or was invested in treasury bills and bonds. Banks began lending to the government.\nFor a long time, the government\u2019s account in our country was in the negative. Not only have our country\u2019s dollar reserves improved, but the Central Bank is now maintaining a reserve of Rs. 01  trillion. Bank interest rates have been kept at single digits for the longest period. This is a very important factor for the economy.\nForeign reserves currently stand at USD 6.3 billion and we expect to accumulate foreign reserves exceeding USD 7 billion by the end of this year. We have to repay debts by 2028. In the debt restructuring programme, a large burden does not fall in the initial years. The amount increases slightly in 2032. Therefore, we have a good six years to prepare well.\nAccording to the commitment between us and the International Monetary Fund, we can obtain commercial loans in 2028. However, our utmost effort is to strengthen dollar reserves without taking commercial loans. Why were we plunged into this crisis? Commercial loans. For the first time in Sri Lanka, we went to the market and obtained commercial loans in 2007. The administration from 2007-2015 obtained USD 3.5 billion in commercial loans. These loans, taken at high interest rates, trapped us in a debt trap. During the period of 2015-2019, when economic experts governed, we obtained USD 12.5 billion in commercial loans. We could not repay these short-term, high-interest loans.\nEven though we will have the ability to obtain loans in 2027, our maximum effort is to achieve debt repayment capability without taking any commercial loans. Therefore, even though people say a debt crisis is coming or the country will collapse in 2028, none of that will happen.\nIn Sri Lanka, typically, a government\u2019s revenue is estimated in the budget. Except for last year, in every preceding year, the estimated revenue was not received. However, this year, for the first time in Sri Lanka, the government is earning more than the estimated revenue. In this way, we have achieved economic victories.\nHowever, we face the challenge of how to extend these high-level economic achievements to the ordinary people. It\u2019s pointless showing economic growth in data if the lives of the people are not improving. But, without creating stability in high economic data, we cannot even consider uplifting the lives of the common people. Therefore, as a first step, we have stabilised the country\u2019s economy. Investors are now coming to the country. We are creating the necessary environment for these investors within the country. Now, we need to ensure that the benefits flow to the people of the country. We will focus on this in the next budget.",
      "A good state mechanism must operate within the country. Our entire state mechanism was in ruins. Vehicles and equipment were old, buildings were dilapidated. To move our country forward from these ruins, a modernised government, suitable for the present, is needed. Therefore, in the upcoming budget, we will place a greater emphasis on modernising the government.\nWe are very successfully completing digitisation. The digital identity card is a very important step in our country\u2019s digitisation. Furthermore, with digitisation, governance will be elevated to a very important level. We will carry out this digital transformation within these four years to elevate the country to a new level.\nEducation is a very important area for improving the lives of rural people. Therefore, we expect a major modernisation of the school system. Our education system is flawed. Our education is on a single linear path. Education should be open to a wide range of possibilities. We will not allow any child who enters school to leave without a vocational or academic skill. Therefore, we are making a major shift in education for societal change.\nAlso, to uplift rural livelihoods, the economic sectors they are engaged in must be developed. Here, agriculture and fisheries must become profitable businesses. The old era of agriculture is over. Today\u2019s supply chain is not seasonal but continuous. Accordingly, we must move to new cultivation plans. We have prepared plans for this. Our products must go out of the country.\nWe also need to create new economic opportunities. The facilities that the government should provide must be provided quickly. In particular, we need a strong public transport service. The cost incurred by citizens for their transport facilities in our country is very high. Therefore, we have prepared plans to develop public transport.\nThe energy sector is also a crucial area. For a long time, the Kelanitissa and Kerawalapitiya power plant systems have been running on naphtha and furnace oil. We will very quickly convert them to LNG. This will enable us to reduce energy costs.\nThere are also several sectors like education, health and agriculture. If we consider the health sector, it\u2019s true that there are medicine shortages in some places. But that\u2019s not a money problem. There\u2019s a crisis in our procurement system. Recently, I summoned everyone in the supply sector. Typically, we have about 6000 tenders. The problem is not simple. Therefore, we will very quickly discuss with the Procurement Commission and move towards a new procurement process for medicine purchases. In this budget, we have allocated sufficient funds for medicines and equipment. However, a large number of tenders for next year have already been called and concluded.\nWe also plan to establish 200 primary healthcare centres this year. A community health centre will be established for every Grama Seva division so that every family has a doctor. Annually, 60 million people receive treatment from the outpatient departments of hospitals. The population is 20 million. That means each person has visited three or four times. We need a strong community health service.",
      "We consider developing health, education and transport as the foremost tasks of our government. Only then can the lives of the people be uplifted. If the government bears the cost of these, citizens will have more income left. That\u2019s how living standards should be improved. Because this government is working with a very good plan, we believe we can elevate our country from its current position to a much higher one.\nIn this journey, expatriate Sri Lankans play a significant role. We are very grateful for your work in gaining power and protecting it. We also understand the problems you face. Especially, we are paying attention to the difficulties in repatriating bodies if someone unexpectedly passes away in the Maldives. It is the responsibility of our government to care for every Sri Lankan citizen, no matter where they live in the world. Therefore, we are focusing on the problems you face. The Maldivian President has agreed to provide us with 90-day visas.\nLet\u2019s work together with the hope of creating a better country than the one we were born into, a country where our children don\u2019t suffer the hardships we did and a future generation with more hopes and aspirations than us. This is the government for that. We ask about what we don\u2019t know. We are ordinary people, not distorted individuals with seven brains. Our specialty is that we absorb capabilities. We give opportunities to those who know. We have no competition. That\u2019s why people from various fields are voluntarily working in our government today. We have given them the necessary freedom. Building this country is the task of everyone with these capabilities. We are undertaking this journey by unifying all these individuals. Thank you once again for your contribution to this endeavour."

    "article_body_paragraphs": [
      "Government takes responsibility for providing optimal school education for every child",
      "\u2013 President pledges during debate on Education Reforms",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the proposed education reform is not merely limited to curriculum revision but will simultaneously elevate both the social and economic spheres of the country.",
      "The President requested support for this initiative, emphasising that it is a social objective, not a political one.",
      "He further stressed that no child should leave school without completing 13 years of compulsory education for any reason whatsoever.",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made these remarks while participating in today\u2019s (24) parliamentary debate on education reforms.",
      "Following is the full speech delivered by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake;",
      "I intend to present a few points during the debate on education reforms.",
      "No one can be satisfied with the current education system, the young generation it has produced, or the economy it has fostered. Therefore, we urgently need comprehensive education reform.",
      "When discussions about education reform arose, issues such as whether history is included in the curriculum or not became the main topic. However, what is being proposed here is by no means merely a curriculum revision.",
      "Instead, these new education reforms are proposed for a fresh transformation of our entire society, our economic body and our country.",
      "From an economic perspective, our country ranks approximately 38th globally in terms of population density. This means we are a densely populated nation; our population density even exceeds that of China.",
      "Regarding natural resources, we have limited large commercial resources. We lack deposits of oil, gas, gold deposits, iron ore, etc. Therefore, our most valuable asset, the resource that needs to be sharpened and honed to build this nation, is our human capital. Consequently, within our economic strategy, we must focus more on how to advance our nation by developing this human resource.",
      "When we classify those who go abroad for employment, we generally categorise them as domestic workers, unskilled, semi-skilled, skilled, or professional. Looking at professionals, only approximately 3% of our expatriate workforce is engaged in professional occupations. The remaining 97% are in skilled, unskilled, or semi-skilled categories. This shows us that there are two global markets: a goods and services market and a global labour market. We have primarily secured a position in the lower-tier global labour market.",
      "Therefore, from an economic standpoint, we must secure a position in the advanced global labour market. For this, we require a high-quality education system that acquires and disseminates the knowledge emerging in the world at any given moment.",
      "On the social front, our illiteracy and poverty are intertwined. If one is uneducated, they are largely impoverished. If one is impoverished, they are largely uneducated. Therefore, even as a programme to eliminate poverty, education plays a massive role in achieving this. In our villages, it\u2019s commonly said that if one person from a family gets an education, the entire family prospers. Hence, education is extremely crucial for escaping poverty. Furthermore, consider crime in our country. Approximately 80% of those imprisoned have not passed the GCE Ordinary Level examination. Close to 70% of drug addicts have not progressed beyond Year 8.",
      "This indicates a connection between social crime, drug abuse and education. Therefore, if we aspire to a positive transformation of this economic body and this society, then education is the seed, the genesis and the foundation of that transformation. This is why we emphasised the necessity of a broad transformation of education in our policy statement. First and foremost, we must identify the scale of the problems within our education system. Because there\u2019s no point in seeking solutions for problems that don\u2019t exist in the real social fabric. We must seek solutions to the crisis our education is currently facing.",
      "One of the crises we face is our children leaving school prematurely. In 2019, approximately 16,673 children left school, rising to 20,759 in 2022 and 20,755 in 2024. This means they are discontinuing their education while still having further years of schooling available to them. My stance is clear: no child should leave school without completing 13 years of compulsory education.",
      "To elaborate, children born in 2006 would have started school in 2011. In 2011, 358,596 children enrolled in school. These same children would have sat the GCE Ordinary Level examination in 2021. However, only around 311,000 children actually sat the exam. This indicates that nearly 47,000 children had left school. Education reforms are essential to retain these children and ensure they complete their 13 years of compulsory education. Our children must not drop out of school midway; no child should suffer such a fate.",
      "A significant number of factors contribute to children leaving school, including their economic backgrounds, parental conflicts, parents emigrating and unsafe conditions. While developing the education programme, if a child is absent from school for three consecutive days, a state official should conduct a personal investigation into that child\u2019s circumstances. Every child must be retained in school up to 13 years of education. This is included in the proposed programme.",
      "Secondly, discussions in our country often focus on higher education. However, the primary issue we face lies within the school education system. In 2023, there were 98 schools with no new admissions. Furthermore, 115 schools had fewer than 10 students, 406 schools had fewer than 20 students and 752 schools had fewer than 30 students. There were 1,141 schools with fewer than 40 students and 1,506 schools with fewer than 50 students. This means approximately 15% of the entire school system falls into these categories.",
      "Moreover, there are 3,144 schools with fewer than 100 students. This means approximately one-third of all government schools have fewer than 100 students. Is this a healthy situation? In such schools, there are no literary festivals, sports days, excursions, or opportunities for children to interact with their peers. Therefore, we must re-evaluate this school system. We will definitely make that decision.",
      "Some schools need to be closed down, others should be amalgamated and new schools need to be established in certain areas. We must consider relocating schools. Every child should have access to a new society, new experiences and new opportunities. Children should not wither away in the same social conditions, moving only between their village and their school. No child should endure this fate.",
      "Some parents refuse to send their child to the village school and desperately try to send them to a city school. Yet, paradoxically, they also fight to keep the village school functioning. What is the meaning of this? We have had extensive discussions with the Ministry of Education about the necessity of visiting and inspecting schools. We are prepared to meet transport needs. Because even if buildings and human resources are available, if a school only has 10 children, it would be more effective to provide a bus service for those children to travel to a city school.",
      "If we take a closer look at the current challenges within our school system, it becomes evident how significantly human resources are being underutilized. The average teacher-to-student ratio in our country is 1:18. Yet, many districts still face teacher shortages. In schools with fewer than 50 students, the ratio drops drastically to 1:5. For example, a school in Hambantota has just 30 students and 9 teachers this reflects a serious waste of human resources.",
      "In Trincomalee\u2019s Kuchchaveli area, one school has only two students and two teachers. Another school in Haldummulla Education Division, Bandarawela has three students and three teachers, while a separate school in Trincomalee has four students and four teachers. In all these instances, neither the students nor the teachers are achieving meaningful results.",
      "Through our education reform programme, the government is taking responsibility for ensuring that every child receives a high-quality school education. This reform involves rethinking the structure and purpose of our school system, which is a critical undertaking. Every child deserves access to a school equipped with proper facilities, qualified staff and extracurricular activities that enrich the social environment they grow up in. Isn\u2019t that the kind of school we should be striving for?",
      "Our education system has significantly mechanized our children. In many villages today, there isn\u2019t even a volleyball court. After harvesting, children play in the paddy fields or swim in the village tanks. During Vesak, they used to come together to draw pictures and build pandals. But such communal and creative activities have all but disappeared. As a result, we are raising a generation of children who resemble machines, lacking warmth, empathy and a sense of social responsibility.",
      "Sometimes I hear parents say, \u201cChildren these days are not like we were.\u201d And they\u2019re right. There ought to be more advanced children at present. Today, tuition starts as early as 4 a.m. They only go to school after finishing extra classes. What kind of life is that for a child? After school, they return to more tuition. Where is their childhood? Do we really want to raise children who don\u2019t enjoy poetry or music? Children who don\u2019t read novels, who grow up without a literary foundation, without social engagement, children who are like machines? A society built on such a foundation cannot move forward.",
      "We must reduce the overwhelming educational burden placed on our children that is our responsibility. Some children are so exhausted that they sleep even after waking up. They sleep in the vehicle and they sleep at school. Don\u2019t we see this? Isn\u2019t it time we changed a system that raises children like robots?",
      "We are now implementing reforms across the entire education system revising subjects, teaching methods and even the volume and weight of the curriculum with the goal of giving children a meaningful and balanced life. Today, the majority of children entering school aspire to become doctors or engineers. But education is not a single, narrow path. It is a wide array of diverse journeys. So what has gone wrong? Our society has placed social value, respect, and professional worth into just two or three fields. Parents believe that for their child to have a good life, they must become a doctor or an engineer. That is simply not true. A society cannot be built on doctors and engineers alone. A healthy, functioning society depends on a broad spectrum of professions. What we need is professionalism across every field. Every profession deserves dignity, value and recognition.",
      "There are many paths in life and our responsibility is to guide children toward professionalism through these diverse avenues. That is the fundamental aim of our education reforms. Every child needs a path to follow. But what has become of that path today? A child cannot truly understand or choose a direction without meaningful dialogue between teachers and parents. Unfortunately, many paths have been reduced to options ranked by perceived social value. For example, a student who doesn\u2019t gain admission to the Faculty of Medicine ends up in the Faculty of Agriculture not by choice, but by default. He becomes an agronomist not out of passion, but because he couldn\u2019t become a doctor. At present, there is a significant disconnect between the Ordinary Level and Advanced Level stages. Our reform process aims to address this.",
      "The new education reform programme will begin gradually starting with Grade 6 in 2026, Grade 7 in 2027, Grade 8 in 2028 and Grade 9 in 2029. That means there are still more than three years before the reforms reach Grade 9. Only when we reach that stage in 2029 will we begin the crucial discussions around helping students identify and pursue the right path for their individual talents, interests and aspirations.",
      "There is a path for a child to become a historian someone who studies the evolution of human civilization. Through that path, we nurture citizens with deep knowledge and understanding of religions and cultures. Isn\u2019t that exactly what society needs? While every child receives a foundational education in subjects like geography, sociology, religion and history, we must go further. We need to foster specialized knowledge that builds upon these basics. For that, a clear, well-structured path must be made available.",
      "In many villages, parents believe that completing the Advanced Level examination marks the end of their child\u2019s education. However, Advanced Level should not be seen as the final stage. Beyond that, we must build a robust national university system and establish advanced vocational training centres that align with the demands of a modern economy. Currently, many vocational training institutions are out-dated some resemble little more than carpentry workshops or small-scale factories. Obviously, children are reluctant to enroll in such environments. A census should be conducted to assess how many students who enter government vocational training centres actually complete their studies. The number would likely be alarmingly low. Many drop out after just three or four months. There remains a stark disparity between the experience of a university student and that of a student in a vocational training centre. This gap must be addressed if we are serious about creating a skilled and future-ready workforce.",
      "Vocational training centres should not be viewed as a fall-back option for those unable to enter university. Our policy is clear: vocational education is not a lesser form of education it is foundational. We aim to establish 40 modern vocational training centres by 2033, integrating both knowledge and technology. Each district will have two such centres, ensuring equal access across the country. Upon completing thirteen years of general education, every child will have the opportunity to enter an open vocational education system. We are committed to ensuring that no child drops out or becomes lost in the education system before completing their thirteen years of schooling.",
      "Traditionally, a child spends thirteen years in school, while a teacher often remains in the system for thirty years. In fact, some of my peers who completed their Advanced Level studies with me are still in the classroom. This raises an important question do our educators possess the updated knowledge and experience required to deliver a modern education? The unfortunate reality is that many do not. Their training and knowledge have not kept pace with the rapidly changing world. How then can we expect to nurture a modern, forward-thinking generation? To achieve this, we must first build a strong, well-equipped generation of teachers. Today, both students and teachers are constrained by an out-dated system. Neither group enjoys true freedom within our current educational framework. This must change.",
      "Therefore, a qualitative transformation in education must occur every five years. To support this, a comprehensive teacher training programme will also be introduced every five years. This on-going\ndevelopment requires maintaining a surplus of teachers to ensure flexibility and continuity in the system. We will manage our existing teaching workforce accordingly. Subject selection within the curriculum should not be determined by politicians. It must be guided by the recommendations of education experts, in line with the evolving needs of society and global standards. Accordingly, we have entrusted this responsibility to professionals with the necessary expertise in educational reform. The role of political leadership is to establish clear timeframes and ensure the successful implementation of structural reforms. While policy direction and reform timelines fall under political authority, the content and direction of education must remain in the hands of those with academic and pedagogical expertise.",
      "Let us engage in a meaningful discussion on the structural transformations needed in education. We must carefully consider the relevant content, subjects and timelines involved. Since we are not experts in every area, it is essential to unite all segments of society and move forward together on this journey. This education reform process is crucial for the strong and sustainable development of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic foundation. Therefore, all political parties should come together to support and implement these reforms. When introducing this new education system in rural areas, it is important not to align with those opposing progress but to actively support positive change.",
      "While some schools have constructed large buildings and theatres, these developments have not translated into tangible educational benefits. To provide optimal education to every child, fundamental reforms of the education system are necessary. Political influence has penetrated provincial schools more deeply than national schools; sometimes they had used teachers from provincial schools for their political activities. As a result, children have become unintended victims of political agendas. There is a prevailing perception among parents that national schools offer better care and quality than provincial schools this perception must be changed. Constructive dialogue is essential to drive new educational reforms.",
      "Sri Lanka currently faces a critical human resource challenge, as there are no competent teams possessing the necessary skills and there is a shortage of officers who demonstrate professionalism. This has led to the weakening of the state\u2019s institutional structure. Therefore, a strong, skilled workforce is urgently needed. This education reform must be pursued decisively not as a political agenda, but as a social imperative to which everyone must contribute."

      "The President made these remarks today (04) attending the launch of the \u201cPrajashakthi\u201d National Programme held at Temple Trees.",
      "The \u201cPrajashakthi\u201d National Programme has been launched as a key initiative of the current government, aiming to empower communities and ensure the fair distribution of economic benefits across society.",
      "The Secretary to the Ministry of Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment, Mr. Sampath Manthrinayake, welcomed participants to the programme. The Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake outlined the objectives of the initiative.",
      "Following this, the Chairman of the \u201cPrajashakthi\u201d National Operations Committee and Minister of Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment, Dr. Upali Pannilage, introduced the national movement.",
      "The official \u201cPrajashakthi\u201d website was also launched by President Anura Kumara Disanayake during the event.",
      "The Full Text of the Speech delivered by President Anura Kumara Disanayake:",
      "A few years ago, our country experienced a severe economic collapse. While there were various contributing factors to this collapse, we must not forget that ordinary people in rural areas, who played no part in its cause, endured the greatest hardships.",
      "They were affected in areas such as food affordability, access to quality healthcare, educational opportunities and the development of rural infrastructure. Therefore, the present government has both a responsibility and a challenge to uplift rural lives. This is a duty that cannot be abandoned.",
      "One of the top priorities of our government is to eradicate rural poverty as a key step towards national progress.",
      "Today, we have managed to bring the economy to a relatively stable state. We have maintained the dollar\u2019s value close to Rs. 300, steadily raised foreign reserves, directed treasury revenue to meet our goals and reduced interest rates to single digits. These are notable indicators of economic stability. We have also been able to gradually restore investor confidence in the country.",
      "Numerous stalled projects have been successfully renegotiated and restarted. In addition, we have received a substantial number of proposals for new investment projects, many of which were approved at the recent Cabinet meeting. Therefore, our focus is now on new investments and development projects. Through these effective and results-driven investments, we can simultaneously achieve economic stability and economic growth.",
      "However, if these economic benefits do not flow to the rural population, then even achieving growth in statistical terms is insufficient. This is why we must pursue economic growth on one hand and economic expansion on the other. If rural people are not given economic opportunities and included as stakeholders in the economy, they will become marginalised. Our core approach must therefore be to expand the economy and integrate rural communities into it.",
      "This is possible only if the current rural economic activities are transformed into more productive, efficient and profitable ventures. These sectors should be developed to become thriving businesses. Widening their access to economic opportunities is also vital. Hence, we are prioritising the creation of new economic avenues for the rural population, making them active players in the economy.",
      "Poverty has gone beyond being an economic issue and become a deep-rooted social problem. Poor communities have become isolated from society. Therefore, eliminating rural poverty is one of the government\u2019s primary responsibilities. Education plays a key role in this. There is a direct correlation between poverty and lack of education. Thus, we must expand educational opportunities further. Despite all efforts, every society has a segment of people who will face difficulties. Even in so-called developed nations, such communities exist. A welfare system is required to support these groups.",
      "Welfare is not inherently a bad tool. If a population is vulnerable at a given time, it is the government\u2019s responsibility to protect them. However, welfare has often been misused, turning into a political tool. This has led to growing criticism of such programmes due to their politicisation.",
      "Our policy under the National People\u2019s Power government is to provide targeted welfare. Assistance must be given to the right people for the right reasons. I believe the government holds this responsibility and society must also understand its importance. In our society, there is a belief that anything given by the state must be received by all. That is a mistaken belief. Our state is not built on such a culture of entitlement. Our culture is to protect those who need protection. Because of distortions in past practices, those who don\u2019t need aid often compete to obtain it, making it harder to support those who truly do.",
      "We must therefore foster a new culture. People must be self-aware enough to recognise whether they truly deserve government support. Even if you have the ability, the person next door mat doesn\u2019t have that ability. It is essential to cultivate a sense of responsibility to assist others. But today\u2019s mentality is to claim whatever is available, regardless of whether one needs it or not. This is the reason we strive to create a strong data system, ensuring that support is provided solely to those who truly require it.",
      "However, we all know that a society cannot rely forever on welfare programmes. There will always be a need for welfare systems, but they must not serve the same individuals or communities indefinitely. Others too must be enabled to become contributors to the economy.\nSignificant government funds have been expended for this purpose. Approximately, Rs. 230 billion has been allocated solely for the \u2018Aswesuma\u2019 programme. Large sums of money have also been spent on other aid programmes. However, have these funds reached the targeted communities? Have the intended benefits been realised from these funds? The answer is no.\nVarious international organisations implement aid programmes in this country. Looking at these, more than 50% of the expenditure goes towards establishing the mechanism for delivering the aid. An official waits to see how they can personally benefit from a project once it is received. They have their job, but the project is not within their purview. They then claim that an allowance is required to implement the project. Consequently, a substantial portion of these aid funds is spent on the aid delivery mechanism rather than reaching the intended beneficiaries. Furthermore, a significant amount has been spent on training within this mechanism. These practices must cease. As a government and as state officials, you have a responsibility to ensure that aid reaches the targeted communities.\nWe assure you that we will absolutely not allow any misuse of these funds. An operation must be launched to ensure that aid reaches those who are deserving.\nSimilarly, there is a tendency for every Ministry to believe they must provide something. However, based on a very accurate data system, it should be determined what should be provided and for what purpose. But what is happening now is not in that manner. Every institution and department is inclined to provide aid. Yet, all aid flowing to rural communities and programmes aimed at empowering their economies must be integrated. A large portion of our aid has been provided merely for subsistence. It has not succeeded in improving the living standards of these people. That is why an integrated operation is necessary. We are launching the \u2018Prajashakthi\u2019 programme as that operation. It is a targeted operation. The programme must be structured down to the Divisional Secretariat level.",
      "Currently, a significant administrative structure has been built. I do not believe a child will be born without a birth certificate anymore. When they reach the appropriate age, they obtain an identity card. In the next two years, we will move towards a digitisation mechanism. So, what is the responsibility of the lowest administrative unit in this mechanism? The responsibility of the lower administrative unit is to understand the nature of its unit and to create a plan to advance that unit based on its characteristics. We must advance the Divisional Secretariat from this point onwards. A programme should be prepared for that. There is a need to spend money there and we are prepared for it.\nI also acknowledge that our state mechanism is largely dilapidated. If you consider all the vehicles owned by state officials, they are all more than 15 years old. More than 50% of the buses on the road are vehicles unfit for road use. The computers in offices are significantly outdated. The systems in our institutions have not been updated. Buildings are deteriorating. From every angle, we have a dilapidated state mechanism. We come to the office like ordinary villagers. That is the honest truth. In the last budget, salaries were increased and necessary support was provided to human resources.\nTherefore, in the upcoming budget, we will work to build the physical resources of the state mechanism. Relative to building physical resources, we will introduce new software systems and modernise the state mechanism. However, this is for the benefit of the citizens. If, within that modernised state, the same old person is sitting in the old chair, there is no benefit. Therefore, within this modernised state mechanism, we need a new public servant.\nThis is the only way we can overcome this challenge. Otherwise, if we scatter, thinking this is a political task, a job for the political authority, or for the Grama Niladhari , the Development Officer, or the Divisional Secretary, it cannot be achieved. To do this, an unyielding, integrated operation involving both the political authority and the state mechanism is required. The objective of the \u2018Prajashakthi\u2019 programme is to bring together the state mechanism, state officials and citizens into an integrated framework. Without this, nothing can be accomplished. Our aim is not merely to maintain the existing state; if that were the case, the current situation would suffice.",
      "To rebuild a fallen state, the political authority, the state mechanism and the citizens must be brought together into an integrated operation. Therefore, there is a community that has lost economic opportunities in this fallen state. An integrated operation is needed to create economic opportunities for that community. I urge all of us to work together to make this \u2018Prajashakthi\u2019 project a success.",
      "Dr. Upali Pannilage, Convenor of the \u2018Prajashakthi\u2019 National Policy Council and Chairman of the National Operations Committee, Minister of Rural Development, Social Security and Community empowerment :",
      "When discussing poverty in our country, the village holds a special place. Not only in Sri Lanka, but internationally, especially when looking at Asia, Africa and Latin American regions, we cannot discuss poverty by forgetting the village. That is why the United Nations declared July 6th as World Rural Development Day.",
      "Although rural poverty in our country has been a subject of discussion for decades, various attempts have been made to change it. However, for example, looking at the statistics for the year 2000, 1.1 million people in our country were dependent on aid. By 2010, this number had increased to 1.5 million. By the end of 2024, the number of people dependent on aid had reached close to 1.8 million.",
      "These statistics confirm that despite numerous programmes implemented to eradicate poverty, the impoverished community in our country is growing steadily. Although the world\u2019s population is rapidly urbanising, nearly 79% of our country\u2019s total population lives in rural or estate areas. Therefore, as the National People\u2019s Power government, when planning our policies, we made the eradication of rural poverty a central theme.",
      "Before launching this programme, we thoroughly studied the weaknesses of the poverty eradication programmes implemented in our country. We designed this programme by addressing those weaknesses and providing answers to the question: How can we truly eradicate poverty in our country? Primarily, we expect to achieve several objectives through this programme.",
      "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya; Sunil Handunnetti, Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development; Wasantha Samarasinghe, Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development; Professor Chandana Abeyratne, Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government; Samantha Viddyarathna, Minister of Plantation and Community Infrastructure; Saroja Paulraj, Minister of Women and Child Affairs; Mahinda Jayasinghe, Deputy Minister of Labour; along with other Ministers and MPs; Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Governor of the Central Bank; Provincial Governors; Ministry Secretaries; state officials; and representatives from international organisations were among those who attended the occasion."

In line with this, they have initiated a research programme as a first step towards the restitution of such cultural objects. An agreement has been reached with Sri Lankan authorities to conduct joint research on colonial-era artefacts currently held in the Netherlands.",
      "As an initial step, it is expected that researchers from both countries will conduct studies on the collection of these ancient manuscripts held in the Netherlands, under the leadership of Sri Lanka\u2019s Department of National Archives.",

      "\u2013 President",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake emphasized the urgent need to rebuild a disciplined and virtuous society by restoring the spirit of humanity in a social environment where power and wealth have undermined positive values and fostered detrimental ones. The President noted that the Maha Sangha of the country can play a significant role in guiding this transformation.",
      "The President made these remarks while participating in the inauguration of the 74th Upasampadha (higher ordination) religious ceremony of Sri Lanka Ramanna sect, held this afternoon (30) at the Mahaweli Grounds in Galnewa.",
      "President Disanayake emphasized that alongside the material victories we aim to achieve, there are also many spiritual triumphs we should pursue. He emphasized that a nation which once listened to the Dhamma preached for centuries based on loving-kindness, compassion and non-violence must now reflect on its present fate and recognize the repercussions of deviating from those principles.",
      "Underscoring the collective responsibility of building a disciplined and virtuous society, the President called on all citizens to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to this mission without delay. He further stated that preserving the continuity and integrity of the Buddha\u2019s teachings requires great care and that significant religious observances such as the higher ordination (Upasampad\u0101) ceremonies play a vital role in sustaining the Dhamma for future generations.",
      "President Disanayake pointed out that certain political groups had exploited nationalism as a tool to regain power. However, he stressed that the true victims of such actions were not the politicians themselves, but the innocent children of parents from both the North and the South. He emphasized the need to reject nationalism and work diligently toward fostering national unity. While affirming that everyone has the right to act freely and democratically, The President emphasized that his administration would not permit nationalism to resurface again. If existing laws are insufficient to suppress it, he stated, they would be strengthened to defeat divisive forces. He reiterated that the goal of his government is to build a society where Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities can live together in peace and harmony.",
      "Addressing the matter of disciplinary discussions within the Sangha, President Disanayake expressed the government\u2019s willingness to facilitate any dialogue, provided that the Mahanayaka Theras can reach a consensus on the matter. Until then, he said, the request to amend Sections 42 and 43 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance has been submitted to the Minister of Buddhasasana and is already under review by the Legal Draftsman\u2019s Department.",
      "Delivering the anusasana, the Most Venerable Aggamahapandita Makulewe Sri Wimala Mahanayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya emphasized that misconduct committed by a very small number of monks is often amplified through social media, resulting in widespread condemnation of the entire Sangha community. The Mahanayake Thera warned that such generalizations have distanced the virtuous public from the Maha Sangha. The Mahanayake Thera further stated that upholding and preserving the Buddhist monastic order is essential and that ceremonies like the Upasampada Vinaya Karma are crucial for nurturing a future generation of well-learned and disciplined monks who can serve both the Sasana and the nation.",
      "This year\u2019s Upasampada Maha Vinaya Karma ceremony of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya is being held from June 30 to July 8, cantered at the Sri Vidyadhara Maha Pirivena in Kalawewa, Kalakarambewa.

      "Following the establishment of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya in the country, the first Upasampada Vinaya Karma (higher ordination ceremony) was conducted in July 1864 at the Mahamodara Udakukkepa Seema Malaka, cantered around the Weliwatta Vijayananda Pirivena in Galle. Since its founding by the Most Venerable Ambagahawatte Indrasabhawara Gnanasami Saranankara Mahanayake Thera, it has maintained a deep commitment to strict monastic discipline and tradition.",
      "Accordingly, this year too, in keeping with long-standing tradition, approximately 400 Samanera monks will be conferred with the prestigious Upasampadha (higher ordination) at the Udakukkepa Seema Malaka at the banks of at the Kalaoya.

      "Government Prioritizes Developing Advanced Public Transport as Nation Moves to New Heights",
      "\u2013 President",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that the primary objective of the current Government is not to pursue incremental reforms within the existing framework, but rather to transform and elevate the nation to a significantly higher level of development.",
      "The President emphasized that the current political leadership has already taken steps to break away from the past political culture and that this transformation must now be developed into a stable and lasting system. Furthermore the President stressed the need for all sectors of the country to work collectively and in alignment to elevate the nation to a new level.",
      "President Disanayake also stated that the government is placing particular emphasis on strengthening the public transport system as part of its broader agenda to elevate the country to a new level. He further affirmed that the government will not allow authorities or individuals to act arbitrarily. It has come to an end under the current administration.",
      "The President further emphasized that society as a whole must develop a sense of fear and accountability when it comes to the misuse of public property and that every individual must be equally subject to the rule of law.",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake made these remarks while attending the ceremonial launch of the \u201cDream Destination\u201d project to modernise 100 railway stations, held yesterday (27) evening at the Presidential Secretariat.",
      "Speaking at the event, President Disanayake further highlighted that statistics confirm approximately eight fatalities occur daily due to road accidents. Accordingly, he highlighted the need for a robust road regulatory framework and underscored that strengthening public transport is essential to reduce traffic congestion, minimise environmental damage by cutting down harmful emissions and ease the heavy financial burden the government bears due to vehicle imports.",
      "Accordingly, the President stated that efforts to develop the country\u2019s public transport system into a modern, accessible and efficient service have already begun. In addition to government investments, opportunities have been opened for private sector participation. He also invited the private sector to collaborate with the government in rebranding Sri Lanka\u2019s railway stations with a fresh and distinctive identity that aligns with contemporary global standards.",
      "The Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation, in collaboration with the \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 Programme and with the support of the private sector, has launched a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project to renovate 100 railway stations across the country.",
      "The aim of this project is to create a clean, attractive railway station network that ensures the safety and comfort of all passengers, including those with special needs.",
      "The Road Safety Action Plan 2025\u20132026 was formally presented to President Anura Kumara Disanayake by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation, Mr. Bimal Ratnayake, during the event.",
      "Speaking at the event, Minister Bimal Rathnayake stated that traffic congestion alone results in an estimated annual loss of 2% to 3% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product. Since around 2012, there has been a significant decline in the public\u2019s reliance on public transport. As a result, even if massive road infrastructure is built in the future, it would not fully resolve the country\u2019s transport challenges. Therefore, he stressed that strengthening public transport has now become an urgent necessity.",
      "To address this, the Minister noted that his Ministry plans to propose the construction of new railway lines from Kottawa to Avissawella and from Avissawella to Ratnapura. It also intends to improve infrastructure to support cargo transportation via rail. Furthermore, while ownership of railroad corridors remains under the Department of Railways, the Ministry hopes to revive and develop the currently unused Nuwara Eliya\u2013Nanu Oya line in collaboration with the private sector for tourism purposes. He added that several other railway development proposals are expected to be included in the upcoming budget.",
      "Murad Ismail, Founder and Chief Architect of MICD Associates, presented the master plan for the railway station modernization initiative at the event. Representing the National Intelligence Organization (NIO \u2013 Engineering), Chartered Engineer M.M.S. Moremada shared insights based on pilot projects carried out at the Maradana, Mirigama and Moratuwa railway stations. He also stated that the organization is prepared to voluntarily offer technical guidance as needed to support future developments.",
      "In parallel, Chief Engineer (Signal and Telecommunication) of the Sri Lanka Railways Department, V.C.E. Jayasekara, highlighted that there are currently 429 unprotected railway level crossings across the country. He noted that enhancing safety at 134 of the most critical locations in the initial phase could significantly reduce the risk of accidents.",
      "During the event, an interactive discussion was held with the participants regarding the \u2018Dream Destination\u2019 initiative. They were also introduced to the online platform established for engagement and participation in the project.",
      "Those present included Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation, Senior Professor Kapila C.K. Perera, Software Engineer Sumudu Ratnayake as well as Heads of several prominent private sector companies and organizations."

The inception of our nation as a heartland for Theravada Buddhist philosophy and tradition was signified on that remarkable Poson Poya Day, when Arahant Mahinda Thero arrived in Sri Lanka.",
      "The arrival of Arahat Mahinda in Sri Lanka sparked a spiritual awakening as well as a deep social transformation, reached far beyond its religious significance. It initiated progress in our cultural, social and political spheres, establishing the foundation for a more enlightened and structured civilization. The way of life rooted in the Dhamma contributed to the emergence of a morally enriched and spiritually conscious society.",
      "King Devanampiyatissa\u2019s significant gesture of laying down his royal bow and adopting a stance of nonviolence upon meeting Arahant Mahinda Thero illustrates the deep-rooted principle of Ahimsa, or non-violence. One of the significant qualities that ought to be emphasized among the values celebrated on Poson Poya Day is non-violence. In a world where violence continues to afflict humanity on many fronts, Poson Poya Day reminds us that \u2018Ahimsa\u2019 is a timeless value that safeguards both one\u2019s own and others\u2019 right to life and freedom. It is a noble practice and a necessary path in today\u2019s world, perhaps now more than ever.",
      "The noble Dhamma gifted to this land by Arahant Mahinda Thero teaches us the importance of seeing \u201cwhat is meaningful as meaningful, and what is meaningless as meaningless.\u201d What we need today are disciplined and responsible individuals who embody this wisdom. The noble duty entrusted to us is to re-establish such a principled society in our land, enabling us to build a modern, morally grounded nation, one that embraces social harmony, ethical values and environmental responsibility.",
      "I firmly believe that the social, economic and political transformation we aspire to can only be realized through the revival of such a cultured and virtuous society. On this Poson Poya day, I invite everyone to come together in unity and collective purpose toward that vision.",
      "May this blessed Poson Poya Day illuminate the hearts of all Sri Lankans with the light of Dhamma."

      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake emphasized that the transformation which took place in Sri Lankan society with the introduction of Buddhism laid the foundation for a disciplined and culturally sophisticated nation.",
      "The President expressed these views while participating in the National Poson Festival held today (10) at the sacred Mihintale temple grounds, organized under the theme \u201cMay the world be enlightened by the teachings of the Buddha.\u201d",
      "Highlighting that the arrival of Arahant Mahinda Thero marked a civilizational turning point, President Disanayake questioned how the Poson Festival could be meaningfully celebrated without remembering Mihintale and its profound significance.",
      "The President highlighted that the spiritual and cultural heritage linked to Mihintale must be preserved and passed on to future generations, a responsibility the State must not ignore.",
      "The President explained that only citizens who are spiritually and culturally grounded who remain connected to the earth and their heritage could truly uphold this responsibility, not those disconnected from reality. He said the government has already initiated a programme to restore and redevelop the ancient city of Anuradhapura in a manner that reinstates its former glory.",
      "The President stated that the foundation for our country becoming a centre of Theravada Buddhist philosophy and tradition was established with the arrival of Anubudu Mihindu Thero in Sri Lanka. This remarkable event, which sparked spiritual enlightenment alongside social transformation, went beyond mere religious significance and enabled the development of more advanced frameworks across all aspects of our nation including cultural, social and political spheres.",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake emphasized that the paramount responsibility lies in re-establishing that society on Sri Lankan soil and building a modern, cultured state for the country one that embraces new ethical, social and environmental principles and that this duty must be unwaveringly fulfilled.",
      "The President stated that the government is undertaking the task of reconstructing Anuradhapura, the site of Sri Lanka\u2019s first city, first reservoir, first surgical operation and the great irrigation canals like Yodha Ela, in a manner that restores its ancient heritage.",
      "The President further noted that the Prime Minister of India has already expressed willingness to support this reconstruction initiative under Indian assistance.",
      "Expressing further views on the occasion, President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated:\n\u201cAny nation needs a strong foundation to rise. For the Sri Lankan people, that strong foundation has been provided through the philosophy of the Buddha. In a society devoid of education, we cannot expect empowered citizens. More than two thousand years ago, it was Buddhism that introduced a transformative change in education to this country. By transforming temples into centres of learning \u201cPirivenas\u201d Buddhism played a vital role in imparting not only spiritual guidance but also knowledge to the people. It paved the way for a well-disciplined and cultured social structure. For this immense contribution, the great monastic leaders who served this country throughout its 2,500-year history deserve the nation\u2019s utmost respect and gratitude.",
      "However, today that social structure has collapsed. Some members of the police have reached a point where they protect criminals. Certain officers at the Department of Immigration and Emigration are issuing travel documents illegally. Underworld figures have been granted passports. Some officials at the Department of Prisons have unlawfully released inmates. Even within the Department of Motor Traffic, some officers are engaged in illegal activities. Citizens do not view these institutions with confidence or peace of mind. Therefore, a well-disciplined civic programme must be established to foster a sense of civic responsibility among the people. The Buddhist philosophy can provide essential guidance in this regard.",
      "As a disciplined nation, we are committed to restoring the integrity of these state institutions. We will not abandon this task, but to succeed, we need the cooperation of the general public. We must bring an end to this era of decline and lead the nation towards a victorious, spiritually and materially prosperous way of life. The people must unite to fulfil this vital responsibility\u201d.",
      "For the past two years, the National Poson Festival could not be held with state patronage. However, expressing gratitude for the firm decision taken to once again hold the National Poson Festival in Mihintale, the Chief Incumbent of the Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya, Most Venerable Dr. Walawahengunawawe Dhammarathana Thero, extended his sincere thanks to the President during the ceremony.",
      "The official welcome and the clarification of purpose were delivered by the Viharadikari of Mihintale, Venerable Surukkulame Indrarathana Thero.",
      "Those in attendance at the event included the Chief Incumbent of Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya, Venerable Dr. Walawahengunawawe Dhammarathana Thero, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, Hiniduma Sunil Senevi, Minister Wasantha Samarasinghe, Deputy Minister of Religious and Cultural Affairs Gamagedara Dissanayake , Deputy Minister Susil Ranasinghe, Members of Parliament Sena Nanayakkara, Thilina Tharuka Samarakoon, Bhagya Sri Herath and Anuradhapura District Secretary Ranjith Wimalasuriya, along with a large number of participants."

      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake declared that the restoration of Sri Lanka\u2019s natural environment is a civic duty that transcends generations, asserting that ecological preservation can serve as a powerful unifying force for the nation. He made these remarks while attending the national ceremony to mark World Environment Day, held at Nidahas Mawatha in Kegalle.",
      "The President emphasised that environmental restoration must begin with the removal of the damaging political culture that enabled destruction in the first place. \u201cThe political authority behind environmental degradation has been dismantled,\u201d he said, issuing a stern message to public officials: \u201cThe time for change has come.\u201d",
      "The national campaign for World Environment Day this year, aligned with the global theme Beat Plastic Pollution, is operating under the sub-theme Let It Sprout. The President explained that this is not a mere symbolic observance, but a call to action, with programmes designed to create room for the environment to recover and regenerate.",
      "Among key decisions announced at the event were: the declaration of Bandula Pethiya\u2019s (Bandula Barb) habitat as a protected sanctuary; the gazetting of four new nature reserves along with the Nilgala Conservation Area; the designation of three schools as Eco-Friendly Model Institutions; and the launch of an evaluation system for Green Railway Stations. The event was jointly organised by the Ministry of Environment, its affiliated bodies, all state institutions, the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat and environmental organisations.",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake further stated;\n\u201cToday is a momentous day. I have addressed many gatherings before and spoken on numerous occasions and voiced many opinions. But what I have to say today is not just another speech. It is a deep expression of commitment and responsibility towards our motherland and our natural ecosystem. I don\u2019t see this as merely a ceremonial event, but as a declaration of our collective feelings and obligations towards environmental protection.",
      "Foreign visitors often tell us how beautiful our country is. And it\u2019s true, we are fortunate to possess an ecological legacy that has shaped our landscape and heritage. That same environment continues to enhance the beauty of our nation even today.\nHowever, beneath this apparent beauty lies a tragic reality. We must ask ourselves: is the beauty we see truly reflective of a healthy ecosystem? Or is it a deceptive surface covering deep-seated environmental destruction? I believe we are facing a profound ecological tragedy.",
      "In our youth, we knew a country free of landslides. But in our lifetime, we have witnessed the devastation of landslide disasters. We knew a Sri Lanka that was not plagued by severe floods or extreme droughts. Yet, we now experience these calamities all too frequently. The human-elephant conflict has reached crisis levels. A nation once known for its vibrant biodiversity now suffers from growing discord between nature and its inhabitants.",
      "We who live in the present have a duty that we simply cannot ignore. We must restore our ecosystems. If this degradation continues unchecked, we will leave future generations with an irreversible catastrophe. Therefore, it is our moral responsibility to safeguard and rehabilitate the environment for our subsequent generations.",
      "Sri Lanka already possesses some of the strongest environmental laws. We have a robust state apparatus capable of enforcing them. Yet, political patronage has been a significant barrier. Many of the coastal sand mining operations are owned by politicians or their close associates; you know this as well as I do. Even forest destruction has taken place under political protection.",
      "Let me say this clearly: do not be agents of ecological destruction. Be agents of life. We will provide the political support needed for you to do so. The political authority has undergone reform, but elements of the bureaucracy remain trapped in outdated practices.",
      "We have discovered officials in the Department of Immigration forging passports. We have found customs officers smuggling goods. There are even mining officials involved in enabling illegal exploitation. These are not isolated cases. That is why I say, let go of the old ways. Embrace change. The time has come. And I will repeat this again and again, either you change, or we will change you.",
      "When I was living in Anuradhapura, water could be found just six feet below the ground. But today, even after digging sixty feet, water is nowhere to be found. We never imagined that, within our lifetime, shops would open in Anuradhapura to sell water. In the past, when we climbed Kadugannawa, all we could hear were the sounds of cicadas or crickets and flowing water and our ears get blocked. But now, that sound is gone. The environment has dried up. We have become a generation that is witnessing this environmental tragedies unfold within our own lifetime.",
      "Many of the reservoirs in the central highlands are now filled with sediment. This raises an important question: did we truly consider the environmental impact when implementing these development projects? Historically, our ancestors never constructed reservoirs within the central highlands. Instead, they protected the highlands and diverted the water that flowed from them to build reservoirs at lower elevations. The Minipe canal system is one such example. In those days, the central highlands were also home to dense elephant populations.",
      "Today, we no longer see flocks of storks or swarms of butterflies in our ecosystem. These are visible consequences of the destruction caused by human activity. Children are now growing up in a world where butterflies are no longer part of their natural surroundings. Therefore, it is our responsibility to restore an ecosystem where butterflies and other wildlife can return. In every field be it economics or education different perspectives may exist. But when it comes to the environment, there can be only one shared understanding the need to protect it. Safeguarding the environment and handing it over to the next generation is a duty that falls upon us as adults. Fortunately, citizens are standing with us in this effort and that gives us the opportunity to restore our natural ecosystems.",
      "When it comes to environmental issues, Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities can all come together. Regardless of the nature of our national challenges, the environment is an area where unity is possible. The environmental sector has the potential to foster national cohesion. We now have an opportunity to rebuild our national environment through a shared national consciousness. That is why we are calling on everyone to \u201cLet it Sprout\u201d.",
      "We have a responsibility to revive this land. A land that has dried up, where water systems have sunk deep underground, and where rapid destruction fuelled by concrete and plastic has taken its toll. I firmly believe it is our collective duty to restore and rebuild such a nation.",
      "In doing so, this is the message we convey to the world: though we may be a small island in size, today we can rise as a giant in conscience. United, we can transform our country into a state that proudly owns a healthy and sustainable environment. When that day arrives, the world will look to Sri Lanka and say:",
      "This is a nation that has reconnected with the land not in conflict with nature, but in harmony with it. Today, we find ourselves in confrontation with the natural world. Let us make it our collective aspiration to build a country that lives in peace with the earth. To achieve this, we must come together as one.",
      "The event was attended by several distinguished guests, including Minister of Environment Dr. Dammika Patabendi, Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province Champa Janaki Rajaratne, and the leader of the Indigenous Community, Uruwarige Vannila Aththo."

      "Coinciding with World Environment Day, fruit and medicinal saplings were distributed to the participating schools, symbolizing the importance of environmental sustainability. Furthermore, a national programme to distribute 20,000 coconut saplings to schools across the island, with the support of the Sri Lanka Air Force, was officially launched.",

      "A special lecture was delivered by Professor Kapila Yakandawala, Senior Professor of Department of Horticulture and Landscape Gardening, Faculty of Agriculture & Plantation Management, Wayamba University of Sri Lanka. He emphasized the importance of planting and maintaining trees with proper awareness.",
      "\u201cIf trees are planted with awareness, the benefits are much greater. Planting trees is important, but so is taking care of them. Just like raising children, trees need nurturing. If neglected, they may grow improperly. After 40 or 50 years, such trees can fall, especially during strong winds as we see now. Although we cannot prevent it entirely, we can reduce the risk. Often, trees that fall have shallow root systems confined to the surface. In rural areas, roots penetrate deeper into the soil. However, in urban environments, we often plant a tree and seal the area with concrete up to the trunk. Trees, like humans, need to breathe. Roots need oxygen. Sealing them causes stress, and when strong winds blow, such trees are the first to fall. Therefore, we must be well-informed when selecting and maintaining trees.\u201d",
      "Also in attendance at the event were Senior Additional Secretary to the President K.M.N. Kumarasinghe, Director of International Media and Strategic Communications at the President\u2019s Media Division Anuruddha Lokuhapuarachchi and Assistant Director Nadeeka Dangolla. School principals, vice principals and members of the academic staff also participated."

While the park spans roughly 471 hectares, only around 9 hectares consist of land. The coral reef surrounding the larger island rises between 100 and 200 meters in height and extends to a depth of around 44.8 meters from sea level.

The core aim of the programme is to transform Sri Lanka into a cleaner, greener and more ethical nation by addressing the country\u2019s pressing environmental, social and governance challenges.",

From June 2 to June 7, a series of awareness programmes will be carried out to educate the public on the importance of tax contributions, how tax revenue supports national development and the tangible benefits delivered to citizens through effective public financing.",

      "Additionally, the implementation of the ASYHUB system at the Sri Lanka Customs Department was carried out as part of this initiative. Developed with the support of the German government and the UNCTAD organization, this modernized system enables importers to complete their customs procedures before the goods arrive in the country. Through this system and the integrated risk management software used by Customs, risk-free shipments are directly cleared at the port and conveniently transported to the respective importers\u2019 warehouses.",

      "Convenor of the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d initiative, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Russell Aponsu emphasized that tax compliance plays a crucial role in building a well-disciplined nation guided by ethical and sustainable development principles.",
      "The full speech delivered by President Anura Kumara Disanayake at the event:",
      "There is a generally negative perception of taxation in our country. Public discourse often reflects concerns about tax wastage, tax evasion and the overall complexity of the tax system. Moreover, institutions have emerged with the sole purpose of advising individuals and businesses on how to evade taxes. These attitudes have developed largely due to the weaknesses in our tax administration system and the public\u2019s awareness of past misuse and mismanagement of tax revenues. Therefore, it is essential that we initiate a broader public discussion on tax compliance, the mechanisms through which taxes are collected, and the prevailing public attitudes toward taxation.",
      "When we examine some of the available data, the picture is far from encouraging. Only 43% of those registered as companies have submitted their tax returns. For the 2023\u20132024 period, only 23% of individuals liable for income tax have filed returns. Among partnerships, the compliance rate is 46%. Meanwhile, just 18% of those liable for PAYE tax have submitted their returns. None of these figures exceed 50%, clearly indicating widespread tax non-compliance and deliberate efforts to evade taxes.",
      "The root cause of this situation lies in the public\u2019s criticism particularly from taxpayers of how past political administrations have misused tax revenues. Therefore, our first responsibility is to assure the people that their tax money will be used appropriately and exclusively for essential needs. That assurance is now entrusted to me and to the current political leadership. As President, I give you my personal guarantee that not a single rupee of your tax money will be wasted or misappropriated by the political authority.",
      "I, as President, have been granted certain privileges funded by public tax money through laws, gazette notifications and Cabinet decisions. However, we have already relinquished many of those privileges. I have made every possible effort to reduce expenditures under the Presidential budget allocation, in order to safeguard every rupee contributed by the people. The Cabinet and Members of Parliament are following the same principle. We are operating under a regime of discipline and accountability. And that is where we begin to set the first example.",
      "We must also build an efficient public service. We are making a concerted effort to transform the relationship between the state apparatus and the citizen into a fast, efficient and fully digital system. At the same time, corruption that has spread throughout the public sector must be eradicated. You are aware that when an ordinary citizen applies for a passport, they must personally visit the Department of Immigration and Emigration, submit their photograph and provide fingerprints. Yet, underworld figures have been issued multiple passports with different sets of fingerprints and several types of photographs. Institutions tasked with upholding our legal framework have themselves contributed to its breakdown.",
      "Similarly, there was a case where a locker belonging to an officer of the Department of Motor Traffic contained a sum of money that could not have been legally earned even over three years. There are serious allegations surrounding the Customs Department. The Excise Department is also affected by similar issues. As a result, while our country may appear peaceful on the surface, a hidden shadow system continues to operate beneath. This underground network is run by organized smuggling rings. Recently, during the opening of a new Customs warehouse system, illegal imports by some well-known branded companies were uncovered clearly pointing to the involvement of powerful players in this black economy. This shadow system has long been protected by political authorities. It also includes certain state officials, illegally armed individuals, and even some members of the media.",
      "Therefore, we are confronting a highly organized shadow system. I assure the people of this country that this shadow system will be dismantled. We are building a nation where everyone is subject to the rule of law. What use is amassing great wealth if, at the age of 61, you end up spending 20 years behind bars? Can anyone justify stealing public funds after receiving their education through public money and drawing a salary funded by taxpayers? All such actions will be punished. This issue regarding public funds is not merely a matter of paying or collecting taxes. It is a deeper, networked problem. Pointing fingers at individual institutions will not solve it, because it is an interconnected system. Therefore, as a state apparatus, we must be fully prepared to deal with it. Anyone unwilling to take on this responsibility is free to step aside. Unless this shadow system is broken, the country will not be able to move even an inch forward. That is why we are committed to dismantling this corrupt network.",
      "Entrepreneurs are conducting their businesses lawfully and paying fair taxes to the government. It is the responsibility of the state to protect that system. Likewise, those who work hard to earn an honest living and pay a portion of it to the government in taxes deserve the assurance that their contributions are safeguarded. That is our responsibility. Therefore, I invite every taxpayer to continue fulfilling your duty. I give you my assurance that every rupee you pay will be protected. And if even a single rupee is misappropriated, I will ensure the full force of the law is brought to bear against it.",
      "In this process, neither power nor social background will be taken into account. Only by cleansing this entire shadow system can we realistically achieve our tax revenue targets. Therefore, our key objective during Tax Week is to send this message to society. To that end, a broad and inclusive social dialogue must be initiated.",
      "When we look closely at the lives of ordinary people, we see that we have failed to create an economy that adequately meets their basic needs. One of the foremost concerns raised by many industrialists and businesspeople is the issue of taxes. Consequently, the most frequent discussion revolves around the perception that taxes are an obstacle to economic activity. Taxes are not a hindrance to economic movement. I am ready to assure every entrepreneur and industrialist that if your industry lacks reliable electricity, we will provide it. If you do not have suitable land to carry on your business, we will acquire and provide it. If you lack access to water facilities, we will supply them. If the roads are inadequate, we will build proper roads. However, you must pay your taxes. No one should request tax concessions in the name of developing their industry or business. Everything else infrastructure, legal frameworks and efficiency improvements we will arrange and provide. But you must pay your fair share of taxes.",
      "We are systematically undertaking the reconstruction of a collapsed economy. We face a significant challenge though I am reluctant to emphasize this, it must be said. What we have inherited is a stalled country. Typically, during a change of government, the country continues to move forward despite political transitions. Many have gained from this momentum. However, what we encountered was a country at a complete standstill. Investments, projects and foreign loans everything had come to a halt. Now, what has been entrusted to us? How do we revive a country that has been stopped on all these fronts? That is our primary challenge. This is why we are striving to revive the projects that were halted, particularly through foreign investments. We believe that within the next two to three months, a substantial number of these stalled projects will be able to restart.",
      "Therefore, what we have is a country that needs to be revived. A country that is running can be held and directed, but what we have is a country that needs to be awakened. In that process, we must first understand the underlying causes that led our country to this collapse. Even in the midst of this crisis, as political leaders, as public officials, and as members of the general public, if we fail to learn from these failures, then we fail as human beings. Some of the root causes of this collapse have even been pointed out by the Supreme Court.",
      "Recently, when punishments were handed down to those involved in corruption and fraud, the judges also highlighted the root causes of this collapse. Through our own life experiences, we have identified the factors that led to this breakdown. Therefore, the responsibility entrusted to us is to thoroughly understand these root causes and prevent their recurrence.",
      "One of the main reasons for this collapse was our failure to properly reform the tax system and collect a fair amount of tax revenue. This crisis was of our own making. If I recall correctly, in around 1996, tax revenue accounted for about 23% of the national income, but it has since fallen to just 7.3%. This decline was a significant factor that contributed to the deepening economic crisis. Hence, it is essential to efficiently collect taxes. This crisis arose precisely because we failed to do so. Over different periods, tax reforms were carried out to satisfy various political agendas rather than economic principles. This politically driven approach to tax reform created a major problem. I assure you that we do not make any economic decisions based on political principles. All our economic decisions are made strictly on economic fundamentals. Politically motivated economic decisions were one of the reasons the country as a whole fell into collapse.",
      "Because we were unable to overcome this crisis on our own, we have become subject to external control. We are being managed from above. Our revenue targets are now set for us. This year, the national income must grow by 15.1%. Of that, 2.3% must be maintained as a primary surplus. We have to manage the economy according to expenditure limits and revenue targets agreed upon by external parties. Why? Because we were the \u201cbad child.\u201d Now, we have been punished and placed under guardianship. Our economy and assets are under guardianship. Are we to remain an economy always under such guardianship? Certainly not. In a discussion with Mr. Mahinda Siriwardhana, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, the consensus was reached that this should be regarded as the final stage of entering the International Monetary Fund\u2019s extended loan programme. We must embark on an economic journey based on our own criteria and targets.",
      "However, at some point, our economy must set economic goals aligned with the public\u2019s aspirations and social expectations. Yet, currently, we are managing an economy partly under guardianship. Therefore, our firm determination is to bring this to an end this phase of the IMF extended loan programme and move forward. To achieve this, our government revenue must be increased. A large portion of this revenue comes from taxes. The bulk of tax collection and administration falls on the Department of Inland Revenue, the Department of Customs and the Excise Department. Therefore, as taxpayers, tax collectors, and tax administrators, let us work together to succeed in this effort. Let us strive to transform an economy under guardianship into a sovereign economy with full independence.",
      "Joining this effort were Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayanta Fernando, Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Harshana Suriyapperuma, Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, along with other senior government officials, provincial governors and private sector representatives."

    "article_title": "Condolence Message Issued by President Anura Kumara Disanayake on the Demise of Veteran Actress Malini Fonseka",
    "article_body_paragraphs": [
      "At this deeply sorrowful moment when Dr. Malini Fonseka, revered as the undisputed icon of Sri Lankan cinema and honoured as the \u201cQueen of the Silver Screen\u201d, takes her final leave from this world, I respectfully seek your permission to offer my own heartfelt tribute to her memory.",
      "Some losses can be replaced. Others are difficult to fill. And then, there are those that are simply irreplaceable. The seat vacated by the Queen of Sinhala cinema is one that will remain forever empty, a permanent void in Sri Lanka\u2019s cinematic heritage.",
      "For over six decades, she graced film, television and stage with unmatched brilliance across the disciplines of acting, directing, producing and screenwriting. Her unwavering presence and enduring mastery across these mediums is a rare legacy.",
      "In a country without even a formal school of cinema, Malini Fonseka ends her life\u2019s journey as a university of cinema in her own right. Her boundless talent could only be equalled by herself. To see an artist even approach her calibre, our nation will need to dedicate several more decades of nurturing and commitment.",
      "Difficult though it may be, this is the only fitting way to truly honour her.\nMalini Fonseka was born on 30 April 1947, a remarkable year in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. It was a time when the nation stood on the cusp of political independence and notably, the very first Sinhala film Kadawunu Poronduwa premiered on 21 January that same year.",
      "She was born into an ordinary family, the third child among eleven siblings, in Kelaniya. At around 16 years of age, she made her stage debut in Noratha Ratha, produced by the drama society of what is now the University of Kelaniya. In 1965, her performance in the stage play Akal Wessa earned her the award for Best Actress.",
      "Impressed by her acting, Tissa Liyanasuriya and Joe Abeywickrama selected her for the lead role in their upcoming film. That film, Punchi Baba, released in 1968, marked her cinematic debut. It is noteworthy that Mr. Tissa Liyanasuriya, who directed that film, is among us during this time of grief.",
      "From Punchi Baba to her final film Akasa Kusum, Malini appeared in nearly 150 movies. Given the time she spent on these films, the nature of the Sri Lankan film industry and the societal expectations placed on women, the heights she achieved are nothing short of extraordinary.",
      "Cinema is broadly classified into three streams: popular cinema, narrative cinema and artistic cinema. Malini Fonseka was a rare actress who triumphed in all three domains. In this regard, she is rightfully considered a treasure of Sinhala cinema.\nI will not attempt to list all her creations or accolades here. Her radiant stardom, rare talent and exceptional skill, sharpened through tireless dedication, formed the foundation of her success. Critics unanimously highlight the range of her roles and the unmatched sensitivity with which she brought those varied characters to life.",
      "Today, the entire nation mourns her loss with genuine grief. Her achievements were not merely personal victories, but triumphs for all Sri Lankans. The honours bestowed upon her were, in truth, honours bestowed upon the country through her.",
      "No one, under any circumstance, can diminish or devalue her monumental contributions. As she departs from this world, both the nation and the people remember her with profound respect. She now takes her place as an immortal figure in Sri Lankan history, a memory that will never fade.",
      "I truly feel that we are bidding farewell to a powerful force that elevated the cultural life of us all.",
      "In this moment of mourning, we offer her the heartfelt gratitude and reverence of an entire nation.",

      "In a milestone moment for Sri Lanka\u2019s financial sector, the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and the National Savings Bank (NSB) reported record-breaking profits for the year 2024, officially presenting their annual reports to President Anura Kumara Disanayake at the Presidential Secretariat today (22).",
      "The achievements, marked by robust fiscal discipline, strategic vision and public accountability, signal a renewed trajectory of confidence in state-owned banking institutions.",
      "The BOC announced a staggering pre-tax profit of Rs. 106 billion, the highest ever recorded not only by a bank but by any institution, public or private, in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. BOC Chairman Kavinda de Zoysa emphasized the significance of this financial milestone, stating, \u201cThis is a historic record as the BOC recorded the highest profit before tax of Rs. 106 billion, the highest profit achieved by any institution, bank or company in Sri Lanka in its entire history.\u201d",
      "He credited the bank\u2019s strategic focus on national development and SME support, adding, \u201cBOC continues as the largest SME and development bank in the country with the best business rehabilitation unit which is futuristic and supports the entire nation.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the NSB posted a dramatic turnaround, reporting a pre-tax profit of Rs. 26.4 billion, a remarkable leap from Rs. 4.2 billion in 2023. Chairman Dr. Harsha Cabral attributed this growth to prudent fiscal governance and effective stakeholder collaboration.",
      "\u201cThe National Savings Bank recorded the highest ever profit before tax of Rs. 26.4 billion for the year 2024. This is a momentous success and a major increase from the Rs. 4.2 billion in 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cThe success of NSB is mainly due to the financial discipline and macroeconomic stability of the country. I dedicate this achievement to the entire NSB family, including our employees, board of directors, senior staff, customers and all stakeholders who support us directly or indirectly.\u201d",
      "Dr. Cabral highlighted that NSB is no longer a burden on the state. \u201cWe are a self-sustaining success story and not a burden on the Treasury anymore. With professional management and financial discipline, the NSB has achieved its targets and hopes to exceed them in 2025,\u201d he noted. He also pointed to internal reforms and staff incentives that bolstered morale and productivity. In 2024, NSB\u2019s workforce was streamlined from 4,600 to 4,200 while maintaining a 262-branch network.

      "Both chairmen underscored a rare but significant aspect of their governance: neither they nor their board members draw a salary for their service. \u201cOur reward is the institution\u2019s success and its contribution to national development,\u201d Cabral remarked, a sentiment echoed by de Zoysa as a model of civic-minded leadership.",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake commended the accomplishments of both institutions, stating, \u201cThese banks demonstrate how strategic leadership and ethical governance can transform public institutions into pillars of national strength. Their performance is a beacon of what\u2019s possible in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic future.\u201d",

You are remarkable mothers and exceptional wives. What should be the genuine result of that sacrifice? The highest form of justice we can provide for your child, husband, friend or relative is to create enduring peace in this nation.",
      "Standing before this memorial and paying proper respect is not just an act of remembrance, it is a solemn pledge. A pledge that we will not allow conflict to rise again and that we will build a society of unity, love and brotherhood instead of one filled with hatred and division, said President Anura Kumara Disanayake.",
      "The President made these remarks this afternoon (19), addressing the 16th War Heroes\u2019 Commemoration Ceremony held at the War Heroes\u2019 Memorial in Battaramulla.",
      "The National War Heroes\u2019 Commemoration Ceremony, held to honour the victory that marked the end of a war spanning over three decades, was conducted this afternoon (19) with pride and dignity at the War Heroes\u2019 Memorial in Battaramulla, under the patronage of Commander-in-Chief, President Anura Kumara Disanayake.",
      "Addressing the event, President Disanayake said;",
      "\u201cFor decades, our nation endured the horrors of war. This conflict, which inflicted immense suffering on our people and land, was brought to an end years ago. Today, we honour the brave military personnel and officers who sacrificed their lives to achieve this peace. This day holds profound historical significance.",
      "This commemoration is not merely a remembrance of the war\u2019s conclusion but also a pledge to unite all communities, Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher and Malay, in building a nation rooted in brotherhood and harmony, rather than allowing divisions to reignite.",
      "Many soldiers sacrificed their lives to bring this war to a conclusion. Their names etched on these memorial stand testament to their sacrifice. Many others were left permanently disabled, while thousands of families still grieve the loss of loved ones. As a nation, we owe them an eternal debt. Their legacy binds us in gratitude and duty.",
      "Yet \u2018war\u2019 is synonymous with tragedy and devastation. Those who fought did not seek war for its own sake; they sought peace. Today, we witness the remnants of this devastation, children orphaned, parents bereaved and spouses widowed. Across our land, from North to South, grief knows no ethnicity.",
      "Children who have lost their fathers, parents mourning their children and wives grieving for their husbands continue to live in this homeland, filled with sorrow. I understand that many are looking for their loved ones\u2019 names be it their son\u2019s, husband\u2019s, or child\u2019s among those engraved on these memorial boards. We are aware of the deep suffering experienced by our mothers, wives and children. They seek their relatives with a sense of pride, yet are burdened by their grief. This is the reality of war.",
      "War is a tragedy. As a nation that has endured this immense sorrow, it is our duty to ensure that such a conflict does not arise again. We must strive to build a society characterized by peace, unity and compassion, replacing suspicion, anger and hatred with brotherhood and love.",
      "Not only in the South, but also in the North, people hold up photographs of their husbands and children on the streets and mourn their deaths. To every parent, their child is precious. So, as a country that has faced such a massive tragedy, our responsibility today is to prevent such a war from happening again in our country.",
      "Our predecessors endured conflict; ours is a generation still grappling with its residual divisions. But we must resolve to leave our children a nation free from strife, a society anchored not in power struggles but in justice.",
      "What lessons do history, marked by its profound tragedies teaches to us? It serves as a powerful reminder that we must prevent such circumstances from recurring in our nation. The past does not indicate that the next generation should be thrust into another war; rather, it illustrates the possibility of a peaceful existence.",
      "This memorial reminds us that true homage lies in forging unity. Let us vow never to permit division again. Instead, let us build a society where brotherhood triumphs over enmity.",
      "Today, I met soldiers who have spent decades confined to beds, some since 1996 or even 1988. Their tears speak where words fail. We must end this cycle of tragedy. Our duty is to bequeath future generations a united nation, not one fractured by exploitation of ethnic tensions for political gain.",
      "At present it is evident that conflicts, racism and extremism have been strategically exploited at various times to acquire sustain and strengthen power. These issues have not emerged naturally; rather, they have been manipulated to secure authority and to obscure the wrongdoings committed.",
      "There is no justification for the Field Marshal to be incarcerated for over two and a half years. At that time, he and I shared a close relationship. It was power that prevailed, rather than law or justice. History has exploited these conflicts and wars to seize and strengthen power. Our children in both the North and the South have suffered as a result.",
      "The ordinary sons and daughters of mothers and fathers from our villages lost their lives in a war for which there was no legitimate reason, no credible justification and no sincere effort to prevent. That is why we must deeply understand that war is a tragedy. War is destruction. Yet, there are some those repeatedly rejected and defeated who continue to view war as something to be desired, as a thrilling experience. But that is not how society as a whole sees it. Should we continue to be silenced by these loud, aggressive voices? No. All of us must rise together and assert, with one voice, our collective need for peace. Our hearts, our words and our actions must be aligned in support of peace.",
      "Today, Peace is increasingly being portrayed as a sign of betrayal. Reconciliation is being distorted into surrender. But as a progressive society we must raise our voices for more than ever for humanity and compassion. This applies not only within our own country, but across the world. What have the wars and conflicts raging around the globe truly brought us? Victory? No only destruction. That is why I believe we must act with unwavering commitment and clarity in our efforts to achieve lasting peace.",
      "That is why I believe we must work with unwavering resolve for peace. We must dismantle the dangerous narrative that glorifies war the false pleasure drawn from rivers of blood shed to gain or protect power. This glorification must end.",
      "Every soldier, every officer who wears a uniform and holds a weapon in respect of the law hopes that the moment never comes when they have to use that weapon. That is the true prayer of humanism. That should be the collective prayer of our society. Yet, a small group constantly dreams of the moment they might ignite violence with the weapon in their hand. No, our position must be firm, we must build a society where no one ever has the opportunity or justification to raise a weapon against another human being. We must not be afraid to say this clearly.",
      "No one should be subjected to oppression. We must only be bound by truth, by humanity and by compassion. We should never be subjugated to authoritarianism. Therefore, I believe that to transform history into valuable experience, we must become a people who learn lessons from those experiences. We have shed enough blood, so much that our land is soaked with it. We are a nation whose rivers run red with blood, whose tears flow endlessly like great rivers from the eyes of our parents and relatives. We are people who have endured the deepest pains and the most devastating destruction caused by war. If these are our experiences, then we must ensure that such circumstances never arise again in our country.",
      "I have stated before that no one takes up arms for the sake of war itself. Every person who picked up a weapon did so for the sake of peace. We do not fight to wage war, we fight to achieve peace. With that understanding, we know that a long journey still lies ahead of us. The end of the war is only the first step, the next step is to establish lasting peace. Without this, we will only be partial victors, not complete winners. True and full victory can only be achieved by creating peace in this country. Therefore, without fear of obstacles or threats, we must be ready to take every possible step necessary to secure peace.",
      "To every soldier holding a weapon and every officer serving our country, I earnestly ask that you always remain committed to working for the peace of our nation. I urge you to continue being those who strive to establish lasting peace in our country in the future as well. To our parents and wives I say this, your children, your spouses, have dedicated themselves to ending the war on this sacred soil. You are noble mothers and spouses. But what should be the ultimate outcome of their sacrifice? The greatest justice we can achieve for your children, your spouses, your friends, and your relatives is the establishment of peace in this country.",
      "We must build a society where our children will no longer live in fear of war. This is an incredibly difficult task, yet it is one we must successfully accomplish. Although this may not be the ideal moment, I feel compelled to say that in both the North and the South, the flames of ethnic conflict have been rekindled fuelled not by any cause other than the struggle for power. The true freedom of our homeland remains elusive; even after ending the war, we have yet to fully secure the complete liberation of our motherland.",
      "What does full freedom of the motherland mean? Even with the current rains, there are regions in the country at risk of flooding and hazards. Can we truly say we are free? Any conflict, no matter how small or where it occurs in the world, affects our nation\u2019s economy and the livelihoods of our people. Are we really free? Today, we are a nation that has lost economic sovereignty. We lack a strong economy that allows us to make independent economic decisions. Therefore, to transform our motherland into a proud nation respected by the world, we must achieve economic transformation.",
      "The supremacy of the rule of law must be firmly established in this country, regardless of any challenges. The world should speak highly of our governance. Our nation must be built as one free from crime and drug menaces. It should be a country without conflict, distrust, or hatred. Only then we can achieve true freedom for our motherland, along with strong and genuine sovereignty. Without this, sovereignty remains merely a phrase on paper, not a reality. We must make this the reality of our motherland.",
      "We both possess an unwavering affection for our motherland. Likewise, we love our people unconditionally. We aspire to transform this land into the most esteemed motherland in the world and to enable its people to enjoy a high standard of living. The essential foundation for this is peace and reconciliation. Therefore, at this critical moment, I firmly believe we must courageously make every possible decision in favour of peace and reconciliation.",
      "The stability, security, spirituality and pride of our fallen heroes who lie ahead of us in this war memorial are all engraved within these walls. We must engrave their spirituality, bravery, courage, and sacrifice into our own lives. Why? to build a more prosperous and peaceful nation. We forever honour in our hearts the heroes who sacrificed their lives to end the war and those who remain permanently disabled because of it. Your dedication, sacrifice, and unwavering courage will become our foundation and inspiration to rebuild this country. For this cause, let us all unite to launch a new struggle a new battle for peace and progress."

      "All procedures related to this sale were carried out in accordance with the Asset Management Circular 05/2024.",
      "The tender sale adhered to the government\u2019s open tender procedure, with the announcement for tenders being publicly released on April 23, 2025, via mass media, the Presidential Secretariat\u2019s website and newspaper advertisements. A total of 108 prospective bidders obtained tender applications upon payment and submitted their bids by the closing date of May 15, 2025. The bid opening took place on the same day at 11:00 a.m. and the sale of vehicles was conducted accordingly, adhering fully compliance with the established guidelines.",
      "Vehicles were awarded to the highest bidders whose offers exceeded the government\u2019s estimated valuation. However, in some cases, the bids received did not meet the government\u2019s minimum valuation. As a result, out of the 26 vehicles offered for sale, only 17 were sold. The remaining 9 vehicles received bids below the government valuation and were therefore not sold.",
      "Accordingly, the details of the vehicles sold during the tender process held on May 15, 2025, are as follows:",
      "",
      "The following vehicles were not sold during the tender process as the bids received did not meet the government\u2019s officially assessed valuations:",
      "It appears that a certain organized group is deliberately generating and disseminating false information through media regarding the recent vehicle sale conducted through the tender process.",
      "This unrest clearly indicates that specific corrupt factions, which previously exploited and misused luxury vehicles acquired and funded by public resources during earlier administrations, are now showing signs of desperation after losing their privileges. These individuals are now resorting to attacking the government over any matter that comes their way, using their affiliated media channels and hired social media propagandists.",
      "In this context, the dissemination of false news reports and the misuse of social media are deeply concerning. Complaints have already been lodged with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) against those engaged in spreading such malicious and misleading propaganda aimed at deceiving the public."

      "The Vesak Full Moon Poya Day, which marks the Birth, Enlightenment and Parinirvana of the Lord Buddha, is a day of profound significance for Buddhists worldwide. It was on such a sacred Vesak Day that the Buddha, having fulfilled the Perfections (P\u0101ramit\u0101s), vanquished the forces of M\u0101ra, cultivated wisdom through the Middle Path, realised the Four Noble Truths and eradicated all defilements to attain Supreme Enlightenment (Samm\u0101 Sambuddha).",
      "Throughout countless lifetimes, the Buddha endured suffering, perfected virtues and ultimately discovered the Dhamma, a timeless truth for the spiritual well-being of all beings. His core teaching was not merely religious but a path to inner development, guiding humanity towards moral and intellectual growth.",
      "The Buddhist philosophy also provides profound insights into good governance. As the Buddha taught:",
      "\u201cSabbam r\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e41 sukha\u1e41 seti \u2013 R\u0101j\u0101 ce hoti dhammiko\u201d (The whole country thrives in happiness \u2013 if its ruler is righteous.)\nThis underscores that when a nation\u2019s leader governs with justice and virtue, the people prosper in peace.",
      "Inspired by the Buddha\u2019s teachings, we must strive to build a prosperous nation rooted in selflessness, equality and social justice, fulfilling the aspirations of our people for a \u201cA Thriving Nation \u2013 A Beautiful Life.\u201d Let us unite with determination and diligence to achieve this noble vision.",
      "Moreover, the Buddha\u2019s message of peace remains ever-relevant. In a world torn by conflict and division, we must embrace the Four Brahmavih\u0101ras, Loving-kindness (Mett\u0101), Compassion (Karun\u0101), Altruistic Joy (Mudit\u0101) and Equanimity (Upekkh\u0101), to foster global harmony.\nMay this auspicious Vesak Festival illuminate all hearts with the light of Dhamma!"

      "\u2013 President Says Delivering Keynote Address at 20th United Nations Day of Vesak Celebrations",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake extended an appeal to the global community to draw upon the illumination of Buddhist philosophy in building a world where the fires of war are extinguished and peace, development and mutual respect prevail among all nations and peoples.",
      "President Disanayake made this statement today (06) while delivering the keynote address at the 20th United Nations Day of Vesak Celebrations, which commenced in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\nVesak celebrations will be held this year under the theme \u201cSolidarity and Tolerance for Human Dignity: Buddhist Wisdom for World Peace and Sustainable Development.\u201d The event, held from May 6 to 8, will bring together over 2,800 participants, including high-level delegates from Buddhist countries such as Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Laos and Cambodia, international delegates from 85 countries and territories.",
      "In his address, President Disanayake highlighted the enduring relevance of Buddhist philosophy in fostering global peace and reconciliation. He emphasised that the teachings of the Buddha offer a path to extinguishing the flames of war and building a world imbued with compassion, tolerance and mutual respect. The President underscored the importance of embracing the Four Brahma Viharas\u2014loving-kindness (metta), compassion (karuna), empathetic joy (mudita) and equanimity (upekkha)\u2014as guiding principles for humanity to overcome suffering and conflict.",
      "President Disanayake expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the celebrations hosted by Vietnam, a nation that has demonstrated remarkable resilience and progress in the aftermath of war. He commended Vietnam\u2019s commitment to peace and its role in promoting Buddhist values on the international stage.",
      "Following is the full speech delivered by President Disanayake;",
      "I am deeply honoured to deliver the keynote address at the United Nations Day of Vesak Celebrations, held in a country that is rapidly and admirably rising, driven by tireless effort, extraordinary determination, focused commitment, strategic vision and remarkable outcomes.",
      "Vietnam is a land that, despite centuries of painful experiences and countless struggles, has courageously forged a path forward and stood tall. We hold immense pride in the victories your nation has achieved, having once been subjected to some of the most brutal injustices in history, including the use of devastating chemical weapons. It is with deep respect that I choose to refer to your nation as the \u2018Land of Determination\u2019.",
      "In a few days, we will mark the Sambudu Themagula, which commemorates the birth, enlightenment and passing away of Buddha. It is a matter of great pride that Vietnam has been selected as the host of the United Nations Day of Vesak Celebrations in conjunction with this sacred event.",
      "In 1999, a proposal was submitted at the United Nations General Assembly to officially recognise Vesak Day as an international observance. This proposal was presented by the late Lakshman Kadirgamar, the former Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka. By the year 2000, the United Nations officially declared Vesak Day an internationally recognised observance. Today, we gratefully remember both the Buddhist and non-Buddhist communities who supported this noble initiative.",
      "In a strong society, power is shared through equality. Without equality, we build not peace, but a world of war. Throughout 2,500 years of Buddhist history, the message of equality preached by Gautama Buddha has been clearly articulated. His teachings on moderation and restraint have now become a practical reality at the global level. Vietnam itself stands as a living testament to this principle of equality. Fittingly, the theme of this year\u2019s United Nations Day of Vesak is also \u2018Equality\u2019.",
      "Even as we speak, violations against human dignity are occurring in parts of the world. Thousands of weapons are directed at humanity. Innocent children, who know nothing of war, are caught in its crossfire and suffer in vast numbers. As a result, women lose their husbands, parents lose their children and children lose their parents. Viewed through this lens, it becomes evident that war brings not triumph, but the destruction of human civilisation. What remains for many after war is only sorrow and suffering. As a nation that endured the agony of three decades of war, we too know this pain. Such suffering can only be prevented through peace and restraint. Until that realisation is reached, what humanity inherits will be nothing but sorrow and pain.",
      "The value of acting with peace and restraint during times such as these was insightfully proclaimed by Gautama Buddha over 2,500 years ago. As Sri Lankans, we have deeply embraced these values. Our country has long enjoyed strong bonds among parents and children, relatives and friends, as well as teachers and students. In our culture, offering one\u2019s blood to save another\u2019s life is regarded as a noble act of generosity. I am not aware of any other country where the donation of blood is considered a form of \u2018d\u0101na\u2019 (giving) in this way. Moreover, organ donation, including eye donation is also practised by our people.",
      "In this way, our country has closely internalised the Buddhist concept of d\u0101na (giving). For over 2,500 uninterrupted years, the Buddha Dhamma has been rooted in the principle of nonviolence. The message of the Dhamma delivered by the Buddha in the \u201cDhamsak Pevathum Sutra\u201d Sermon continues to resonate with relevance and expand across the globe today. The Buddha has shown us a path, one that is vastly different from the road that leads to the destruction of human civilisation.",
      "As we walk the path the Buddha taught, we are guided to fight not with weapons, but against the inner enemies of anger, jealousy, hatred, aversion, and delusion. The Dhamma offers powerful means\u2014through the cultivation of loving-kindness (mett\u0101), compassion (karu\u1e47\u0101), sympathetic joy (mudit\u0101), and equanimity (upekkh\u0101)\u2014to combat these defilements.\nThis spiritual arsenal, rooted in mindfulness and compassion, is far stronger than any weapon of mass destruction. The Dhamma taught by the Buddha is aimed at overcoming the enemies within. Choosing the path of war leads only to sorrow, tears and profound suffering. But by choosing the path of peace, one comes to truly understand the Dhamma.",
      "We can also learn how deeply the Dhamma can influence a life by looking at the reign of Emperor Ashoka. His rule became known not for the sound of war drums, but for the reverberation of the Dhamma. Those once enthralled by the thrill of war began to experience the joy of loving-kindness. On one occasion, when a conflict arose between the Sakyans over water from the Rohini River, the Buddha himself travelled to Kapilavatthu to demonstrate the greater value of peace over war. Time and again, the Dhamma has emphasised the supremacy of peace.",
      "In today\u2019s world, which has become a global village, the teachings of the Dhamma on compassion, peacefulness and patience, make a profound contribution to our understanding and way of life. The Buddha, as a great teacher, championed both restraint and freedom of expression, encouraging individuals to question his teachings repeatedly in order to realise the Dhamma with clarity and wisdom.\nIn the truest sense of the word, the Dhamma is one that must be realised through personal insight. Following this path, Buddhist monks today carry the message of equality across the world. This message contains no seeds of conflict, no incitement to violence, no shedding of blood, nor any form of punishment. It is the path of peace.",
      "Through moral education, the Dhamma teaches us to respect one another and that hatred does not cease by hatred, but only through non-hatred. The Buddha was the first teacher to preach the message of global peace. His instruction was for each individual to place trust in themselves. In this way, Buddhist philosophy offers a deep and profound guide to living.\nThe Buddha delivered teachings on Buddhist resources and restraint in the Sig\u0101lovada Sutta. This Sutta outlines how acquired resources should be utilised, specifying that one part is for consumption, two parts are for strengthening the economy and another portion is set aside for use during unexpected situations.",
      "In addition, the Buddha provided guidance on governance. He instructed rulers to protect human rights by suppressing crime, fostering economic prosperity and leading the country in accordance with moral and spiritual principles. The Buddha\u2019s political philosophy offers a framework for rulers that emphasizes governance based on virtuous policies.",
      "His message was clear: \u201cWhen the ruler, the first citizen of the country, governs wisely, the people will live in peace and prosperity.\u201d This is a key aspect of the Dhamma taught by the Buddha.",
      "The Buddha\u2019s teachings on governance also include many valuable concepts, particularly within the context of the ten royal virtues (Dasa R\u0101ja Dharmas). These principles guide the ethical and moral conduct of a ruler, encouraging peace and equality. For this reason, I firmly believe that the entirety of the Buddha\u2019s Dhamma conveys a message of peace and equality, central to its core teachings. The Buddha has also taught that all things are impermanent.",
      "One of the well-known verses that summarises the teachings of all the Buddhas is as follows:",
      "\u201cSabba p\u0101passa akara\u1e47a\u1e43 \u2013 Kusalassa upasampad\u0101\nSacchitapariyodapana\u1e43 \u2013 Etam Buddh\u0101na S\u0101sana\u1e43\u201d",
      "The simple meaning of this verse is: \u201cRefrain from all evil, cultivate good and purify the mind.\u201d This is the essence of the teachings given by all the Buddhas.",
      "Sri Lanka and Vietnam have maintained close and mutually beneficial relations for centuries. In recent times, these ties have grown even stronger. Just yesterday, I had the privilege of unveiling a unique Bodhi enclosure at the Bai Ding Pagoda in Vietnam. This enclosure houses a sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, which was gifted to Vietnam by Sri Lanka in 2023.",
      "As followers of the Buddha\u2019s Dhamma, we strive for a world free from the fires of war, a world filled with peace, love, and compassion. I call upon all people to embrace the teachings of the Buddha and the Buddhist philosophy, fostering peace, development and mutual respect among all nations and peoples."

Responding to the people\u2019s aspirations, we of the National People\u2019s Power currently focused on developing a nation that is experiencing extensive economic, social and political transformation.",
      "We have already succeeded in initiating a stable recovery of an economy that was dragged to the depths by corrupt and elitist system. The evident signs of advancement are now apparent to everyone. In our very first national budget, we made historic moves significantly increasing the minimum basic salary of public servants and extensive benefits for various segments of society, including farmers, fishing community, youth, women, students, producers, small-scale entrepreneurs and professionals alike. We are diligently addressing the persistent issues encountered by plantation workers and striving to guarantee their civil rights.",
      "We recognize the necessity for a new phase in the rights we possess, aligned with the continuously evolving productive forces. Contemporary society demands a new era in human rights that encompasses digital access, environmental rights and other emerging rights that were not anticipated in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These changes, along with evolving political frameworks and the worldwide call for peace, require a revised and comprehensive global declaration of human rights. As we commemorate this International Workers\u2019 Day, we must remain sensitive to these needs and dedicated to addressing them.",
      "In the face of global geopolitical shifts and growing challenges, it is the working people of Sri Lanka who continue to shoulder the burden of rebuilding our economy. As we restore and reform an economy devastated by decades of corrupt politics, I warmly invite our beloved working people to join hands in solidarity, to rise with determination and to strive towards building \u201ca beautiful life and a thriving nation\u201d for everyone. On this occasion, I offer my heartfelt best wishes for a meaningful International Workers\u2019 Day one that reaffirms the rights and dignity of all working people."

It is our solemn responsibility, particularly at this time of renewal, to nurture those values within ourselves and to foster a more compassionate and ethical society.",

      "As we welcome this New Year, I call upon all of you to come together with renewed strength, unity and goodwill. Let us collectively work towards a common purpose, supporting the government\u2019s vision for economic, social and political transformation and thereby ensuring enduring progress and prosperity for our country and all its people.",

      "\u2022 Enforcing the Law Against Corruption is Not Political Revenge but a Moral Duty\n\u2022 The Law Will Be Strictly Enforced Against the Official Mechanism that Engages in Corruption\n\u2013 President says at the Launch of the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that since assuming office, the current government has taken decisive steps to free the process of combating bribery and corruption from political interference. He emphasised that while the political mechanism has been liberated from engaging in such crimes, it is now the responsibility of the administrative machinery operating beneath that political structure to fall in line and correct its course without delay.",
      "He explained that a grace period of six months has already been provided for the state officials to adjust to this new direction. The President firmly warned that if the public service mechanism fails to act appropriately within this period, the government will not hesitate to take firm legal action against those officials from May onwards.",
      "President Disanayake expressed these views today (09), participating in the launch of the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan 2025\u20132029, held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo.",
      "The President pointed out that bribery and corruption have destroyed the dignity and values of Sri Lanka\u2019s state administration and caused the nation to fall behind for decades in the eyes of the world. He reiterated that enforcing the law against these crimes is not an act of political revenge but a profound human responsibility.",
      "He observed that over the past six months of the present government, no section of the public service has been allowed to collapse and that if officials continue to resist change, the government will proceed to remove and replace them after May.",
      "The President stressed the need to build a society that respects the law and fears wrongdoing, adding that conducting lectures or workshops alone would not suffice in achieving this goal. He emphasised that people must practically witness that any person who commits a crime will be subjected to punishment under the law.",
      "President Disanayake noted that corruption in Sri Lanka ranges from minor bribery, such as obtaining medicine through corrupt means at a rural dispensary, to grave financial crimes like looting the Central Bank. He stressed that although corruption may appear to start small, it has expanded to deeply inhumane levels.",
      "He further accused previous rulers of safeguarding and protecting those engaged in corrupt activities, allowing such practices to spread from village-level institutions to the highest financial institutions in the country.",
      "He also revealed that within several state administrative institutions and even among certain bodies responsible for enforcing the law, criminal networks consisting of organised corrupt officials and underworld elements have been operating, creating systemic webs of theft and fraud. He confirmed that these criminal networks have already been identified and assured that measures will be implemented in the future to dismantle and eliminate them.",
      "President Disanayake solemnly pledged that the responsibility of eradicating bribery and corruption will not be passed on to the next generation but will be resolved within this generation itself, under the leadership of the present government.",
      "Drawing a comparison with India, which gained independence a year before Sri Lanka, the President noted that through a consistent national policy framework, India has successfully achieved space exploration and built a massive workforce in the software industry. In stark contrast, he pointed out that Sri Lanka, due to poor decisions made by its political leadership, was declared a bankrupt state in 2022.",
      "He further stated that the current government has taken on the responsibility of leading Sri Lanka towards the international stage through a national policy framework that ensures transparency and accountability for every rupee spent from public funds.",
      "The President added that by implementing this framework, it is possible to build public trust in law enforcement and judicial institutions and that it must be made clear to the people that there will be no mechanism available for anyone to escape the law after committing a crime.",
      "He stated that the purpose of the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan 2025-2029 is to guide the country towards becoming a nation of integrity. The government plans to establish internal control units within all state institutions, under the leadership of the Presidential Secretariat and implement a system for monitoring these units through digital technology to ensure accountability and transparency.",
      "The Action Plan has been designed around four key strategic priority areas: prevention and education, public participation, institutional strengthening and the enforcement of law along with reforms in law and policy.",
      "The President highlighted that eliminating bribery and corruption is one of the most decisive factors in a country\u2019s development and progress. In Sri Lanka, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has been identified as the leading state institution entrusted with strengthening this mechanism. Accordingly, it was recognised that a robust national anti-corruption policy that operates across all sectors is essential to creating a corruption-free society.",
      "In preparing this Action Plan, CIABOC engaged all relevant stakeholders by conducting extensive programmes at both national and provincial levels. A broad public consultation process was carried out, including a comprehensive survey to assess public opinion on corruption through media announcements in all three languages and via social media networks.",
      "This process gathered proposals from a diverse range of participants, including Members of Parliament, judges, state officials, the private sector, international organisations, civil society organisations, community-based organisations, religious groups, persons with special needs, media professionals, youth, children and the general public. Additionally, foreign state experiences and suggestions from various groups across all provinces were taken into consideration when formulating the Action Plan.",
      "By implementing this National Anti-Corruption Action Plan, the government hopes to foster a committed citizenry determined to combat corruption, a political will fully supportive of this effort, a comprehensive legal framework and a disciplined, transparent public service across all sectors, with the shared vision of building a country of integrity for future generations.",
      "Addressing the event, the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, HE ISOMATA Akio, stated that Corruption remains a great challenge for many countries, including Sri Lanka as it undermines economic growth, weakens public trust in government institutions and discourages foreign investment. However, he noted that due to the reform initiatives of the present government, investors are once again showing increasing interest in Sri Lanka.",
      "Ambassador ISOMATA Akio further stated that Japan has always believed that transparency and good governance are fundamental pillars for sustainable economic development and therefore, has supported anti-corruption initiatives globally for over a decade.",
      "Meanwhile, the UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka, Ms. Azusa Kubota, stated that according to Sri Lanka\u2019s first-ever National Taxpayer Perception Survey conducted last year, 84% of respondents indicated that corruption directly affects their willingness to pay taxes.",
      "She further noted that corruption deters investment, increases the cost of doing business, undermines sustainable development and human security, and causes an estimated annual loss of USD 1.3 trillion for developing countries.",
      "Referring to the Budget Speech delivered by the President, Ms. Kubota emphasised that the State must be accountable for every cent of taxpayers\u2019 money and stated that this Action Plan would serve as a roadmap for transforming Sri Lankan society.",
      "",
      "The event was attended by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Murdu Nirupa Bidushinie Fernando; the Attorney General, Parinda Ranasinghe PC; the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake; the Chairman of CIABOC, former High Court Judge Neil Iddawela; the Director General of CIABOC, R.S.A. Dissanayake; the Commanders of the Tri-Forces; the Inspector General of Police; senior officials from the security forces and a large number of state officials."

I consider it as a historic occasion to recognize the achievements of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, who assumed office with a strong public mandate to transform the political culture and overcome long-standing prejudices that had hindered his country\u2019s progress toward becoming a modern, developed nation.",

As civilizational partners, Sri Lanka and India have grown close across every sphere, including history, language, religion, ethics, art, culture, architecture, and beyond, reflecting the richness and dynamism of our two nations.\nOne of the closest and most enduring examples of friendship that we fondly recall is India\u2019s gesture during the 1996 Cricket World Cup, when India joined Sri Lanka in an exhibition match after two teams declined to tour our country due to security concerns. We take this opportunity to once again express our heartfelt gratitude for that act of solidarity.",
      "Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign policy is firmly guided by national interests, with a focus on promoting peace and respecting the sovereignty of all nations, principles that form the foundation of our diplomatic roadmap.

      "The 58th edition of the National New Paddy Harvest Festival was organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Services under the theme \u201cIn unison, let us cultivate the land, to build a self-sufficient nation\u201d (\u0d85\u0dc4\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dba\u0d82\u0db4\u0ddd\u0dc2\u0dd2\u0dad \u0daf\u0dd0\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dad\u0db1\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0da7 \u0d91\u0d9a \u0db8\u0dd2\u0da7\u0da7 \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0dc0\u0dd2 \u0db6\u0dd2\u0db8\u0da7), following the guidance of the Atamasthanadhipathi, the Most Venerable Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera.",
      "This ritual, which dates back to the era of ancient monarchs, saw the participation of farmers from across the country. In accordance with tradition, they prayed for timely rains and fertile fields and invoked blessings for a self-sufficient and prosperous economy through agriculture.",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake first paid homage and received blessings from the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi before joining the ceremonial proceedings.",
      "The sacred procession, which carried the newly harvested paddy from near the historic Sinha Kanuwa in Anuradhapura, arrived at the sandy courtyard (\u0dc0\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0db8\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0dc0) of the Sri Maha Bodhi, marking the ceremonial commencement of the New Paddy Harvest Festival.",
      "The Most Venerable Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera commenced the ritual by filling the golden bowl with the new paddy, after which representatives from all provinces added paddy from their respective regions, symbolically filling the golden bowl.\nPresident Anura Kumara Disanayake also participated in this ritualistic moment, amidst the chanting of Pirith by the Maha Sangha.",
      "A vessel of pure bee honey, traditionally offered to the Sri Maha Bodhi, was ceremonially presented to the President by Deputy Leader of the Vedda Community W.U. Bandiyala Eththo.",
      "The vessel of ghee, brought from the historic Saman Devalaya in Sabaragamuwa, was also presented to President Anura Kumara Disanayake, to be used in the customary ghee offering at the Sri Maha Bodhi.",
      "The President also received the commemorative plaque of the 58th National New Paddy Harvest Festival and presented tokens of appreciation to farmer leaders who have made significant contributions to the development of the country\u2019s agriculture sector.",
      "As part of the initiative to secure a pest-free harvest, the President participated in the distribution of pest-resistant seed paddy to farming communities across the provinces.",
      "Addressing the subsequent official ceremony, President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that the current government is working to transform an economy that was in disarray. He noted that the Paddy Marketing Board is burdened with a debt of Rs. 28 billion, while harvested paddy is being left to spoil in storage.",
      "The President emphasized that the current administration has accepted the responsibility of restoring and restructuring this disordered system. He added that the government expects the support not only of the state machinery related to agriculture but also of all farming communities. He affirmed the intention to integrate Sri Lanka\u2019s cultural and traditional systems to reclaim the legacy of the agricultural economy and thereby strengthen the national economy.",
      "President Disanayake further stated that the country\u2019s ancient kings achieved greatness through their contributions to agriculture and irrigation and that self-sufficiency in food was a critical factor in that success.\nHe highlighted that sustainable development has become a global discourse today and that Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cTank Cascade System\u201d or \u201cVapi System,\u201d stands as a remarkable example of sustainable development. The country\u2019s irrigation system, which dates back nearly 2,000 years, continues to contribute to the advancement of agriculture even today.",
      "As such, the government has allocated Rs. 2 billion in the current budget to rehabilitate the irrigation system and renovation work on the North Central Maha Ela Project has already commenced to revitalize the country\u2019s agricultural industry. He added that the government also plans to develop seed farms to produce self-sufficient seeds, while protecting genetic ownership.",
      "He further emphasized the need for fair prices for agricultural produce, both for farmers and consumers. Due to long-standing market distortions, the government will intervene over the next two to three harvesting seasons to ensure both parties receive fair prices.",
      "The President also stated that the necessary provisions for such state interventions have been made in the current budget. Steps have been taken to create storage capacity to hold 300,000 metric tons of paddy, which is expected to mitigate market distortions going forward.",
      "Among those present at the occasion were the Chief Incumbent of the Ruwanweliseya and Chancellor of the Rajarata University, Most Venerable Ithalawetunuwewe Gnanatillake Thera, the Chief Incumbent of the Lankaramaya, Most Venerable Ralapanawa Dhammajothi Thera and members of the clergy; Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation K.D.

      "As part of the series of programmes conducted for schoolchildren by the Presidential Secretariat, the Ministry of Education and the Sri Lanka Parliament Department of Communication, a special Student Parliament session for Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, was held today (25) at the Old Parliament Chamber of the Presidential Secretariat. The event was conducted under the patronage of Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya.",
      "During the session, the student parliament members of Visakha Vidyalaya had the opportunity to gain insights into the conceptual and practical significance of the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d initiative.",
      "A special commemorative edition of the \u2018Vision\u2019 magazine, which focuses on the student Parliament initiative, was presented to the Prime Minister by Nadeeka Dangolla, Assistant Director of Parliamentary Affairs and Executive Functions.",
      "Furthermore, the Principal of Visakha Vidyalaya, Mrs. Manomi Seneviratne, presented a special commemorative token to Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya.",
      "Addressing the gathering, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya highlighted that the government\u2019s commitment to implementing new educational reforms aimed at nurturing a generation capable of seizing economic opportunities.",
      "The Prime Minister further stated that the government aims to prepare Sri Lankan children to acquire global knowledge while fostering a self-reliant and empowered future generation.",
      "The Prime Minister stated that the objective of the new education reforms is not only to align education with job market demands but also to cultivate skilled youth who can contribute to the economy and provide leadership to society.",
      "Furthermore, she underscored the government\u2019s commitment to addressing resource disparities among schools and emphasized the significance of civic responsibility in this endeavour.",
      "Speaker Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne\n\u2018Leadership must be devoid of selfishness. Selfless leaders guide both the nation and its people towards a better direction. To achieve this, skills must be enhanced. We can learn about talented leaders from both Sri Lankan history and global history. We should study as children how Chandashoka transformed into Dharmashoka and how Hitler\u2019s regime brought devastation to the world. A nation achieves stability when leaders who prioritize minimal personal consumption and demonstrate a true dedication to their nation arise. Therefore, we must strive to cultivate leaders who can face challenges and prioritize national interests. By fostering selflessness, we can ensure a prosperous future for our people.\u2019",
      "Senior Presidential Media Advisor Mr. Chandana Sooriyabandara\n\u2018The students gathered here today are not just future leaders; they are leaders already. Leadership knows no age. Anyone who stands for a group could be consider as a leader. Those who exercise the power of the group are considered leaders. Throughout Sri Lankan history, individuals who contributed to the country through their words and actions have played leadership roles. Therefore, logical reasoning should lead the process of making decisions. Both leaders and citizens share the duty to act rationally. You all have a duty to shape a prosperous nation through logical thinking, and this obligation lies with every young person.\u2019",
      "The event was also attended by Deputy Speaker Dr. Rizvie Salih, Deputy Chairperson of Committees Hemali Weerasekara, Secretary-General of the Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera, Senior Additional Secretary to the President K.M.N.

    "article_body_paragraphs": [
      "\u2013 President tells Parliament",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that the National People\u2019s Power (NPP) government has stabilized the economy over the past four months that has instilled confidence in the country\u2019s ability to move toward a prosperous future.",
      "He further noted that the government has achieved numerous economic victories, increased state revenue, and resumed several stalled development projects initiated with foreign assistance, thereby signaling economic stability to the nation.",
      "President Disanayake made these remarks yesterday (21) during the parliamentary debate on the third reading of the budget.",
      "He asserted that those who attempt to disrupt this national progress for political gain will ultimately be rendered irrelevant in politics. He emphasized that the only path available to all politicians in the country today is to align with and support the government\u2019s development agenda.",
      "Additionally, the President stated that the era of media-driven politics has come to an end, arguing that if such an approach were still effective, the current government would not have come to power. He described the present administration as a political movement that remains engaged in continuous dialogue with the people.",
      "Reflecting on past opportunities to rebuild the nation that was squandered, President Disanayake stressed that neither he nor his government would let the current opportunity slip away. He reiterated that their mission will only conclude once the country has been fully rescued from its current challenges.",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that neither he nor any minister in the government harbours personal ambitions; instead, their only aspiration is the well-being of the country and its people. He firmly assured that this vision will be realized and invited all members of the opposition to be active participants in the nation\u2019s journey toward success, rather than being remembered in history as obstacles to progress.",
      "Further elaborating on his views, the President remarked:",
      "\u201cThis is one of the longest budget debates held in Parliament in recent times. Previously, adequate time was not allocated for such discussions, but we ensured a full-length debate. During this discussion, various points were raised; some out of pain, others out of anger. Some of these concerns were valid. We are not surprised by expressions of pain or anger. When lands in Hanthana are lost, pain is inevitable. It is saddening. The documents related to this matter are available at the Presidential Secretariat. We understand the frustration and outrage. However, we must also be prepared to embrace what is beneficial and reject what is not.",
      "We are a political movement that firmly believes the country\u2019s economic system must undergo a decisive transformation and we are actively working toward that goal. Moreover, we clearly understand how to implement this transformation. If the economy were in a strong and crisis-free state, this shift could happen swiftly. However, given the dire economic situation, the transformation must be carefully planned and executed over time.",
      "Therefore, we fully understand the concerns being raised. For a long time, this country has followed economic policies that have failed to serve its people. Now, we are taking decisive steps to establish an economy that benefits both the country and its citizens. To achieve this transformation, our first priority is to stabilize the economy. An economy burdened by multiple crises cannot withstand sudden, large-scale changes. A vehicle with broken wheels cannot make sharp turns; first, the wheels must be fixed. That is why we are systematically working to steer the economy forward with careful planning.",
      "We inherited a state that was officially declared bankrupt, not just officially, but in reality as well. There was a massive gap between the country\u2019s revenue and expenditure. While the expected total revenue was LKR 4,999 billion, debt interest payments alone required LKR 2,950 billion. Additionally, LKR 1,352 billion was needed for public sector salaries and LKR 442 billion for pension payments. This meant that from the total revenue of LKR 4,990 billion, LKR 4,744 billion was immediately spent on interest, salaries and pensions, leaving only LKR 246 billion. An economy in such a dire state cannot be turned around overnight.",
      "Furthermore, the country is burdened with a significant amount of debt and a collection of state institutions that incur massive annual losses. Last year, the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation recorded a loss of LKR 256 million, with outstanding debt amounting to LKR 1,834 million. The Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation reported a loss of LKR 152 million, while its debt stood at LKR 1,603 million. The Independent Television Network (ITN) had a debt of LKR 1,476 million. Lanka Sugar Company carried a debt of LKR 11,165 million, the State Plantation Corporation owed LKR 3,216 million, Milco (Pvt) Ltd had a debt of LKR 15,090 million and SriLankan Airlines was burdened with nearly LKR 340 billion in debt.",
      "With such conditions, the revenue generated by the state was barely sufficient to cover the fundamental expenditures I previously outlined. The country we inherited was one with highly concentrated and insufficient revenue. Additionally, the segment of society contributing to the national economy was extremely small. For instance, 90% of Sri Lanka\u2019s export income is generated by just 10% of exporters. Similarly, approximately 69% of the revenue collected by the Department of Inland Revenue comes from around 600 tax files.",
      "Moreover, we had become a bankrupt state in the eyes of the world; a country unable to secure loans and one where trust in the banking system had collapsed. Therefore, our first and foremost responsibility was to stabilize the economy. Without economic stability, we were not prepared to undertake any major transformations. History has shown that every economic shift attempted without first achieving stability has resulted in negative consequences.",
      "When we took over the government, Sri Lanka was already engaged in a four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We were faced with two choices: either to continue with this program or to abandon it. While many expected us to walk away from the IMF agreement, we did not fall into that trap. We knew that given the fragile state of the economy, even a small misstep on our part could lead to severe economic repercussions. As a government, our primary responsibility in restoring a collapsed economy was to ensure that we did not make even minor mistakes.",
      "Accordingly, our first priority was to establish economic stability in the country. Today, no one can claim that Sri Lanka lacks economic stability. I must emphasize that we worked tirelessly to achieve this stability. As a key milestone in this effort, on December 21 of last year, our country was officially declared free from bankruptcy. Until that point, we were a state that had defaulted on its debt. However, we have now transitioned to a country that, while not currently repaying its debt, has reached an agreement on its repayment. We have secured an extension until 2028 to begin settling our outstanding debts.",
      "As a bankrupt nation, our country suffered immense damage. Consequently, many development projects that were dependent on foreign aid came to a halt. However, after Sri Lanka was freed from bankruptcy, the respective countries have decided to resume these projects. This is a clear indication of the country\u2019s growing stability.",
      "Additionally, with the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Sri Lanka on April 5, work on the Sampur power plant is set to commence. Similarly, within the next two months, a new solar power plant in Siyambalanduwa and a 50-megawatt wind power plant in Mannar will begin operations.",
      "We have successfully steered the country from economic instability to stability. We have restored confidence among businesses, investors and international financial institutions regarding Sri Lanka\u2019s financial standing. Today, the exchange rate has remained stable at approximately LKR 300 per USD for the past three years; an achievement that had not been seen in recent history.",
      "Furthermore, Sri Lanka has transitioned from being a high-risk debtor nation to one with reduced debt risk. Trust in the banking system has been reinstated and interest rates have been brought down to single digits. By mid-year, we anticipate achieving positive inflation growth. In the past two months, the highest recorded remittance inflow from migrant workers in recent history was received, signifying growing confidence in the country\u2019s economic stability.",
      "Additionally, Sri Lanka has seen a significant influx of tourists. As of March 17, over 610,000 tourists had arrived in the country. We can confidently predict that this year will see the highest number of tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka\u2019s history.",
      "In Parliament, we have often observed discrepancies between estimated and actual revenue figures. However, in 2024, the Department of Customs met the estimated revenue target. We initially projected an income of LKR 356 billion from the Inland Revenue Department, but by March 17, the actual revenue had reached LKR 438 billion. Similarly, in January, the Customs Department\u2019s revenue surpassed its estimated target.",
      "Furthermore, we are striving to generate revenue that exceeds our projected income for this year. Achieving economic stability is crucial for the country, as substantial transformations in the economy cannot be realized without first securing such stability. In the past, private entrepreneurs lacked confidence in the nation\u2019s economic landscape. Progress cannot be made without fostering trust among key economic stakeholders. The economy cannot be managed based on mere intuition; rather, we rely on data, analytical assessments, and conclusions drawn from those analyses to steer the country\u2019s economic direction.",
      "The decision to permit motor vehicle imports is a highly sensitive one, and we are continuously reviewing it to ensure we achieve our intended objectives.",
      "You are free to engage in political discourse as much as you wish, but we earnestly request that false information, which could destabilize the economy, not be disseminated. Individuals identified as economic experts must ensure their statements are responsible, as reckless claims can create significant instability in the financial markets. Stabilizing the economy is not solely the government\u2019s responsibility; it is a collective duty that we must all fulfill as citizens and public representatives.",
      "We may engage in political debates, but I must once again appeal that false and damaging economic information not be spread. In a well-functioning economy, such statements may not have severe consequences. However, at a time when we are carefully navigating an economic recovery, it is critical not to create unnecessary doubt. If you have concerns, let us discuss them. Do not irresponsibly propagate unverified claims. This is a moment when we must all act responsibly to stabilize the economy.",
      "At the same time, we cannot allow the lives of our citizens to stagnate until economic stability is fully achieved. We are systematically implementing measures to boost local production while also providing necessary relief to safeguard the livelihoods of the general public. Accordingly, we have increased the fertilizer subsidy from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000 and, in a recent Cabinet decision, allocated an additional Rs. 15,000 for excess crops cultivated in paddy fields. Furthermore, we have enhanced compensation for harvest losses. We will never abandon our duty to support the people.",
      "We have allocated a Rs. 6,000 allowance for 1.6 million schoolchildren to purchase books and supplies. These programs are being implemented despite the economic challenges we face. Additionally, we have increased the allowance for kidney patients from Rs. 7,500 to Rs. 10,000 and raised the elderly allowance from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000. Moreover, we have increased the pensions of retirees by Rs. 3,000. We remain committed to the welfare of our citizens.",
      "We have taken steps to increase the Mahapola scholarship from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 7,500 and the student allowance from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 6,500. Additionally, we have decided to provide an allowance of Rs. 5,000 for orphaned children and deposit Rs. 3,000 into their fixed savings accounts. Furthermore, when an orphan, particularly a young girl, residing in a state institution reaches the age of marriage, we have allocated Rs. 1 million for the construction of a house. We take full responsibility for the welfare of these children. We have also increased the daily meal allowance for preschool children from Rs. 60 to Rs. 100.",
      "Regarding salary increases for public sector employees, we focused on two key issues. There was a prevailing trend of skilled government officials leaving the country, and simultaneously, we struggled to attract individuals with specialized expertise and competence to the public sector. Despite financial challenges, we recognized the necessity of implementing a meaningful salary increase for public sector employees.",
      "This was an unanticipated increase in basic salaries. We implemented this increase based on a scientific approach, alongside enhancements to other allowances. We also made adjustments to previously unaddressed salary scales to ensure tangible improvements. However, if future adjustments to this framework are deemed necessary while safeguarding core principles and integrity, we are prepared to take action. Our ultimate goal is to establish an efficient and well-functioning public sector.",
      "What, then, is the opposition doing today? Even if I were to assume the presidency today, I would still be entitled to a parliamentary pension\u2014a fact I was previously unaware of. However, upon learning of it, I immediately submitted a request to Parliament to forgo this pension. A Member of Parliament who becomes President receives both the parliamentary pension and the presidential salary. In the past, such benefits were distributed at will. Similarly, when an MP is appointed as a Minister, they receive both a ministerial salary and a parliamentary salary. However, we have decided that our ministers and deputy ministers will only receive the MP salary.",
      "If we are to transform this country, the political system must change. Accordingly, we are expediting the introduction of a bill to abolish parliamentary pensions. We are also swiftly amending the Presidents Entitlements Act and presenting it to Parliament. In the near future, we will introduce several key bills that all members of Parliament should unite to support. Furthermore, MPs will no longer receive duty-free vehicle permits, and we uphold the policy that a Member of Parliament should receive an official vehicle only during their tenure.",
      "We have also reduced the number of Cabinet Ministers to 21, with Deputy Ministers appointed accordingly. Ministers are no longer provided with official residences. Establishing political stability in the country is essential, and when ministers and politicians lead by example through sacrifices, public servants must also be prepared to follow suit. Instead of engaging in superficial debates over dignity and pride, we must focus on substantive progress.",
      "We have paid special attention to the issue of unemployed graduates and are ensuring that job placements follow a proper policy framework. We have identified 15,300 vacancies in the public sector, and the relevant committee has approved the filling of these positions. As a result, we plan to recruit 30,000 individuals into government positions, ensuring that the process is carried out transparently and systematically. However, we must avoid unnecessary over-recruitment, and I urge all members of Parliament to exercise restraint in this regard. We recognize the importance of public service, but the financial burden of maintaining the public sector is extremely high. Therefore, we are proceeding with a carefully planned approach.",
      "If our government were merely to continue the existing system, governance would be far easier. However, the people elected us to bring about meaningful reforms for the nation\u2019s progress.",
      "In this endeavor, the business community plays a critical role. Everyone must pay taxes fairly, and we are committed to enforcing the law against tax evasion. At the same time, we assure that every rupee collected in taxes will be safeguarded and utilized responsibly. We also plan to introduce special incentives for taxpayers.",
      "We must rebuild public trust in the nation\u2019s tax system. We are fostering a new political culture to achieve this. When people are confident that their tax contributions are managed transparently and efficiently, they will willingly comply. In the past, taxpayers hesitated because they saw their contributions being misused. We are committed to changing this perception and restoring trust in the system.",
      "Moreover, professionals must contribute to national development. The government must ensure that essential services are provided without imposing additional costs on the people. Corruption weakens the public sector and hinders economic growth. Corruption is an economic crime, and we will take strict measures to address it. The state must be reformed. We must eliminate the deeply rooted culture of corruption within the government apparatus.",
      "We are also committed to creating a more investment-friendly environment within the country, introducing an Investment Protection Act. Additionally, we are in the process of amending the Strategic Development Projects Act to ensure that tax concessions are granted based on national requirements rather than personal affiliations. This legislation will be presented to Parliament promptly.",
      "Furthermore, we anticipate significant reforms in the education sector and have initiated a project to streamline the school system. By expanding vocational training and educational pathways, we aim to transform the education system in a way that secures a brighter future for the country\u2019s children.",
      "We are implementing necessary relief measures to support small and medium-scale entrepreneurs while also planning a substantial transformation in the agricultural sector. A major initiative is underway to develop a port-centric maritime economy, and with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, we are expediting the construction of the Kerawalapitiya Container Terminal.",
      "Through these measures, we strive to stabilize the national economy and guide the country towards its future goals. It is essential that we all come together and strengthen this journey as we move forward."

      "Esteemed state leaders, distinguished delegates representing various organisations, honoured guests, members of the media and all those present, I seek your permission to address this extraordinary summit.",
      "It is a great privilege to speak at this significant gathering, held at a crucial juncture in human history, at a time when the world calls for unprecedented global cooperation.",
      "My country is a beautiful island nation with a unique history, a present filled with optimistic dreams for the future and a citizenry that possesses broad political and social awareness. The people of my country have a deep sense of empathy for events occurring anywhere in the world. While they cherish their traditions, they also demonstrate the wisdom and openness necessary to embrace change when required.",
      "Moreover, if you were to search the internet at this very moment with your mobile phone and ask, \u201cWhich country has the highest number of eye donations in the world?\u201d the answer would be the nation I represent, located at the edge of the Indian subcontinent: \u2018Sri Lanka\u2019.",
      "It is a great honour and privilege for me to represent a nation of such altruistic and warm-hearted citizens, I take immense pride in addressing you on their behalf.",
      "I believe that this summit, which focuses on developing future strategies and policies concerning critical aspects of human progress, will contribute positively to global well-being at some point.",
      "Today, the challenges we face at national, regional and global levels are vast and complex.",
      "Some choose to ignore these issues, embarking on self-cantered journeys. However, isolated problems of today soon evolve into global concerns of tomorrow, knocking on everyone\u2019s doors ultimately bringing an end to solitary pursuits.",
      "Therefore, I reiterate the importance of uniting as global citizens to confront cross-border challenges together. Addressing these crises requires collective global action and a unified front.",
      "Effective Governance and Accountability\nEnhancing governance accountability and efficiency is essential for the future world. Citizens must be encouraged to transition from individual efforts to collective initiatives.",
      "The structure of state institutions and bureaucratic systems must prioritize accountability and responsibility, as these are crucial for the future of governance.",
      "Social justice and the rule of law are not only vital for a regulated state but also for a well-functioning professional world. Proper implementation of agreements and laws, systematic support for low-income and vulnerable communities and ensuring accountability through an independent media and social activism are all of paramount importance.",
      "The emergence of digital access rights, environmental rights and other new rights\u2014along with evolving political systems\u2014highlights the need for an updated universal declaration on human rights, which was not envisioned in the 1948 declaration. This moment serves as a reminder of the importance of awareness and proactive engagement in addressing these pressing issues.",
      "As we strive to build a global community founded on sustainable values, it is crucial to uphold respect for the diverse cultural traditions across the world.",
      "Financing the Future and the Global Economy\nNearly 60% of the poorest countries are either in a debt crisis or at high risk of one, raising serious concerns about the future of the global economy. With tightening global financial conditions, the prospect of massive debt repayments and a poorly prepared international financial structure, the global economic outlook appears increasingly precarious. Transforming into a fair and equitable financial system is of critical importance.",
      "Climate, Crisis Mitigation and Resilient Cities\nThe world is heading toward the devastating consequences of uncontrolled industrial growth, including climate change, loss of biodiversity, and severe corruption. These issues are more frightening than a catastrophic celestial event that could impact Earth in a matter of years. While many developed countries have historically contributed to three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions, their exposure to the impacts of climate change remains relatively low. Despite significant advancements in development, many naturally beautiful low-income countries are being ravaged by the harmful actions of others. These countries and islands, once known for their pristine coastlines, are now plagued by these disasters. If you ever visit our country, you will be astonished by the breath-taking coastal areas surrounding\nus. We are committed to making enormous efforts to protect our coastlines and preserve their beauty.",
      "Human-Cantered Future and Sustainable Growth\nThe digital revolution has already transformed the way people live, work, and communicates. While these technologies have the potential to help billions of people lead happier, healthier, and more productive lives, they also create new challenges for citizens and governments around the world. It is important not to forget that the very technologies that empower individuals can also present significant risks. Take a computer virus, for example\u2014though it doesn\u2019t attack with a bullet or a nuclear bomb, it can wreak havoc in ways that are far more dangerous than traditional warfare, as evidenced by the increasing threat of cyber-attacks in recent years.",
      "Global Health Transformation\nOver the next two decades, population growth, urbanization, and the rise of antimicrobial resistance will likely contribute to the continuation and expansion of several health challenges.",
      "As humans, we are inevitably interconnected. For over a year, a virus caused much of the global population to conceal their faces behind masks, creating significant pressure in both wealthy and impoverished nations.",
      "In 2024, the world saw an increase or resurgence of several infectious diseases. Among non-communicable diseases, cancer has had an extraordinary impact on people\u2019s lives. At this moment, millions of cancer patients are fighting for survival. Heart disease, regardless of national borders, continues to devastate lives, and it has become a major global crisis. Health experts predict that by 2030, the economic cost of mental health disorders worldwide could exceed $16 trillion.",
      "The climate crisis is expected to result in an additional 14.5 million deaths by 2050, according to predictions.",
      "In this context, it is crucial to focus on digital health, new technologies, and modern health tools, as well as the relationship between environmental health, sustainability, and health financial cooperation for economically vulnerable countries.",
      "At times, you may represent the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe, or the West. However, the problems we all face and the call for unity, as expressed through the \u201club dub\u201d sound in our hearts, urge us to build the world together.",
      "As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \u201cWe must learn to live together as brothers.\u201d If we don\u2019t, he also foresaw the consequences.",
      "We have united with a purpose to provide our people with \u201ca thriving nation, a beautiful life,\u201d a goal that has been historically endorsed.",
      "At this historic summit, I urge you to join us in building a beautiful life and a beautiful world.",

      "Aimed at accelerating Sri Lanka\u2019s digital transformation, three key digital initiatives were officially launched today (07) at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Disanayake.",
      "These initiatives include the establishment of the GovPay government digital payment platform, the expansion of the President\u2019s Fund services to the Divisional Secretariat level, and the introduction of the eBMD system for obtaining birth, marriage, and death certificates through embassies.",

      "Through the GovPay platform, payments for all services related to 16 government institutions can be processed in the initial phase. Starting from April, an additional 30 government institutions are planned to be integrated into the platform. Moving forward, there is an ambition to unify all government institutions under this system. Currently, 12 state and private banks have already joined the platform.",
      "Speaking at the event, President Anura Kumara Disanayake emphasized that technological advancements play a pivotal role in improving people\u2019s lives by delivering efficient, high-quality, and cost-effective services. He noted that throughout history, technological progress has been a driving force behind societal advancement, continuously elevating human civilization.",
      "The President also highlighted that the President\u2019s Fund has traditionally been managed from Colombo, which has posed significant challenges for citizens in remote villages. To address this, the fund\u2019s operations will now be decentralized to the Divisional Secretariat level, ensuring greater accessibility and convenience.",
      "He further stressed that such transformative decisions should have been made long ago, as delays in policy implementation have hampered economic progress and public welfare. However, with digitalization, urban and rural communities are now more interconnected than ever, making technology a vital tool in addressing rural poverty and resolving grassroots challenges.",
      "President Disanayake reaffirmed that digitalization is the key driver that can propel Sri Lanka to a new stage of development, enabling citizens to meet their needs seamlessly, free from obstacles, inefficiencies, and bureaucratic delays.",
      "President Anura Kumara Disanayake emphasized that due to the mechanized nature of modern life, the Sri Lankan people have gradually lost their connection to cultural living.",
      "However, he pointed out that digitalization could facilitate the revival of cultural life, making it essential to ensure the success of this initiative. He further stated that the introduction of the Digital National Identity Card (Digital ID) marks a key milestone in this transformation.",
      "The President stressed the urgency of implementing these changes rapidly, highlighting that transparency, efficiency, and bridging the urban-rural divide are critical to Sri Lanka\u2019s digital transformation. He assured that the government is making significant efforts to elevate the nation to a new level through digitalization.",
      "Senior Advisor to the President on Digitalization and Chairman of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya, stated that Sri Lanka already possesses 75% of the necessary skills to build a strong digital economy. However, to fully unlock this potential, the remaining gaps must be addressed, with a goal of completing this process within the next three years.",
      "As part of this initiative, the President\u2019s Fund was officially decentralized to the Divisional Secretariat level, enabling online application submissions for financial assistance.\nTo further drive digital transformation, a system was introduced allowing Sri Lankans living abroad to obtain certified copies of birth, marriage, and death certificates through their respective embassies. As an initial implementation, a Sri Lankan resident in South Korea successfully received a birth certificate through the online system.",

At this moment, we stand together to take on the challenge of rebuilding a thriving nation \u2013 a beautiful life; something that was lost and eluded us over the past century.",
      "For the sake of our future generations, we must elevate our nation to new heights. This was the very expectation of all the heroes in our history who struggled to achieve it with their blood and tears. Therefore, both individually and collectively, we must build a modern, developed Sri Lankan nation, guided by social, environmental, and ethical principles.",
      "As the new government, over the past four months, we have laid the foundation for a stable economy, introduced a new political culture, and committed ourselves to a new political ideal. We strive for a society where people regard each other with equality, respect, and empathy; \u2014free from racism and religious divisions. We focus on governance through public engagement and the rule of law, while prioritising the eradication of rural poverty. Our policies and actions aim to ensure that no citizen, particularly the most vulnerable, is left behind. Steps have also been taken towards digitalising the economy to embrace advancements in science and technology that we previously missed. Additionally, we are committed to transforming Sri Lanka\u2019s global image\u2014from a country known for corrupt governance to one that upholds an independent foreign policy and earns trust in international relations.",

Now, the task ahead is to systematically build upon this foundation and realise a centuries-old dream with unwavering confidence and creativity.",

That moment marked the inaugural instance in our history when we secured political independence. This island, which had been partially subjected to Western imperialist rule since 1505, was entirely subsumed as a British colony in 1815. It is on a day such as today that the political prerequisites for emerging as an independent state, liberated 77 years ago, begin to be fulfilled. Therefore, it is a day worthy of celebration.",
      "Today is a day to honor all the valiant heroes who rendered immense sacrifices to render this day possible. Moreover, even after 1948, as we carried forward the mantle bestowed upon us to realize complete freedom, additional courageous souls have traversed arduous paths in pursuit of our liberation. We have journeyed far to reach this moment of celebrating our 77th anniversary of independence, having borne that baton through the passage of time, including the pivotal year 1972, when we attained full political sovereignty under a constitutional crown. In that journey, we have arrived at this day, forged by the blood and sweat of thousands of gallant people, both celebrated heroes and heroines as well as the unsung ones, who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. We hereby pay our homage to all of them in this moment.",
      "Today, as the democratically elected President of this state, I stand before our proud national flag in Independence Square, not only as your leader but as a brother who has borne the historical burden emblematic of our future freedom. I am confident that you stand with me in this moment, sharing in the weight of this burden.",
      "Together, we must embark upon a journey towards economic liberation and socio-cultural emancipation, in short, towards the freedom essential for us to live with pride as contemporary citizens of this nation. Not only must we overcome the ethnic, religious, and caste divisions that have long fragmented and subjugated us as subjects, but we must also eradicate the entrenched prejudices that exist between political representatives and the populace, between institutional leaders and their staff, between passengers and public transportation operators, between government employees and the citizens they serve, between educators and students, and so forth. We must purify our society by eradicating these prejudices and reaffirm that human dignity, love, and compassion, the hallmarks of the modern era, form the bedrock of all human relationships. Similarly, as citizens of this nation, we must not permit the respect or affection inherently owed to every human being to be curtailed by disability, age, illness, or any other such limitation.",
      "Only when we have fully commemorated 77 years of liberation from colonialism can we reimagine freedom for our nation.",
      "Therefore, we must recognize that in our quest to attain comprehensive economic, social, and cultural freedom, each of us is a warrior on the same battlefield. Collectively, we must persist in our struggle for freedom on behalf of this motherland.",
      "In this endeavor, you, as farmers and fishermen who sustain our nation with food, as educators who cultivate knowledge and nurture future generations, as healthcare professionals who safeguard the well-being of our people, and as members of the police and security forces who ensure the safety of our citizens, bear an indispensable responsibility. Equally, those who fortify our manufacturing sector, propel our nation toward industrialization, and bolster our service economy, from garment factory workers to the women who harvest tea leaves in the highlands, from expatriates laboring abroad to those striving to elevate our nation through information technology, and from advocates of the tourism industry, each of you plays a crucial role in nurturing our motherland.",
      "To secure our economic freedom, rather than succumbing to weakness in the global economic system and being overwhelmed by its every fluctuation, we must unite in our efforts for this motherland. In our pursuit of economic liberation, we must remain steadfast, never relegating our social and cultural freedom to a subordinate position.",
      "Consequently, as artists, writers, journalists, and scholars, you bear an indispensable responsibility to purify and rejuvenate our national spirit, which has been tarnished by hatred and anger. In this context, religious leaders have likewise been entrusted with a profound responsibility.",
      "Similarly, as devoted mothers and fathers nurturing the future generations of this nation, you, too, have a vital role to fulfill.",
      "Likewise, as the sons and daughters diligently studying today in preparation to steward this nation tomorrow, you possess a unique and crucial role.",
      "Just as the mantle of responsibility to lead this nation into the future was entrusted to us through the sacrifices, blood, tears, and sweat of those who loved our country immeasurably, so too shall we one day bestow that honorable responsibility upon you. However, on February 4, 2025, as we commemorate our national independence, 77 years since our liberation from colonial rule, I must pledge one promise to you. The nation we bequeath to you is not merely the country that history has conferred upon us, but your own homeland, a nation in which you can aspire to live as global citizens. It is a nation that reveres human dignity and embodies an elevated cultural ethos. Moreover, it is a country that guarantees your right to partake in the scientific, technological, and intellectual advancements that human civilization has realized thus far, as citizens of this Sri Lankan state.",
      "I assert this unequivocally before you today, for we possess no legitimate excuse to squander this magnificent opportunity bestowed upon us by history. The future will attest that we have not faltered in this regard. I am equally confident that you will guide this cherished motherland into the future with even greater devotion and vigor than we have demonstrated.",
      "As human beings, our inalienable duty, by virtue of our existence on this earth, is to render this world a haven of elevated humanity, and to ensure that all individuals have equitable opportunities to partake in and embody that higher humanity. Our struggle for freedom is intrinsically intertwined with this noble aspiration.",
      "Therefore, let us envision that dream of freedom collectively, let us bring that dream to fruition together.",
      "Perhaps you and I, indeed all of us, are united on this journey, and it is imperative to remember that this journey has the potential to render our motherland, this Sri Lankan state, an enduring exemplar of freedom and democracy in the contemporary political landscape. Although we may not emerge as the wealthiest nation globally, through our concerted efforts, we can evolve into a model state of equality and freedom, one that epitomizes the richest national spirit in the world."

      "Previous governments have failed to attract investments effectively, and the Board of Investment (BOI) has not operated efficiently. To address these issues, a new structure has been proposed through the Economic Transformation Act. However, this Act currently lacks a comprehensive implementation mechanism. The present government intends to move forward with the Act, incorporating necessary amendments.",
      "",
      "In the past, decisions made by political authorities faced resistance when implementing those decisions by the state mechanism. The state mechanism always assumed that political authority was trying to enforce hidden agendas. However, we have now proven that there are no concealed motives within political authority. Therefore, we believe the state mechanism will cooperate with us. In this process, even the state mechanism\u2019s attitudes must change. If decisions are not made within a specified timeframe, the expected outcomes cannot be achieved. Digital transformation is essential\u2014not only to improve efficiency and convenience but also to elevate the country to a new level. Therefore, digitizing government services is a priority at this stage. The implementation of a Electronic National Identity Card, despite previous misconceptions, presents an opportunity to create a globally relevant identity system. The Indian government has already pledged Rs. 10 billion to support this initiative.",
      "",
      "It is clear that a new administrative framework is needed. The existing state administration has proven to be ineffective and corrupt. Additionally, accessing public services comes with a significant financial burden. Some institutions no longer serve a necessary function. While they may have been established to meet past needs, there is currently no proper plan to utilize them effectively. There are multiple state institutions operating within the same sector, which leads to inefficiency. Therefore, these institutions must be consolidated to ensure better management and resource allocation.",
      "",
      "Around 90% of Sri Lanka\u2019s export revenue is generated by just a few organizations. Similarly, 69% of customs revenue comes from only 621 files. Furthermore, while the Western Province contributes 37% to the national economy, the Uva Province contributes only 5%. Concentrating the economy in the hands of small groups will not allow for sustainable economic expansion.",
      "",
      "The \u201cAswesuma\u201d program benefits 1.8 million individuals, but there are still more groups that require support. To eliminate rural poverty, it is essential to create new economic opportunities. The current government aims to introduce new sources of economic growth at the village level. When this happens, economic benefits will flow to rural areas, and by increasing the productivity and capacity of the people, rural poverty can be alleviated.",
      "",
      "Until now, Sri Lanka\u2019s approach has largely been focused on providing aid to individuals. For example, targeting a single person by giving them a cow or a few chickens as assistance. If such methods had been effective, Sri Lanka would now have numerous large-scale farms. Recognizing this limitation, the government is now planning to empower communities by creating new economic opportunities that focus on sustainable growth.",
      "",
      "Within the framework of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) criteria, the government is strengthening support programs for those in genuine need. A targeted plan is also in place to stimulate financial growth. Previously, welfare mechanisms in Sri Lanka were heavily politicized. The current administration has ended this practice and established a system to ensure that aid reaches only those who genuinely need it.",
      "",
      "Although the term \u201cfree market\u201d is often used, the global market is not entirely free. It is divided into different segments, and the government is working to secure a share for our country in this fragmented global market. One of the key strategies being studied is expanding into the global market by leveraging our proximity to India, which is one of our closest markets. The government is reviewing the previous trade agreement with India, considering its advantages and disadvantages, and aims to establish a new trade agreement to better position Sri Lanka in the global market.",
      "",
      "The world doesn\u2019t stop based on statements. Currently, declarations made by the United States may lead to conflicting or alarming situations, but the world continues to move forward despite such statements.",
      "",
      "To build the country, we must all unite. Providing government services comes at a significant cost. The government workforce stands at 1.3 million, and while there is an excess of lower-level employees, there is a substantial shortage of mid-level staff. If exams were conducted, even individuals employed in the private sector would be interested in government positions. Therefore, a dialogue is needed to transform the private sector into an attractive place of employment as well.",
      "",
      "In 1991, the government provided companies with certain benefits, but even after 32 years, a plantation worker still doesn\u2019t earn more than Rs.1,700 daily. This raises questions about the success of those companies. Recently, customs officials opened containers that had been brought in illegally. However, there was no one present to claim responsibility for them. Upon inspection, the containers were found to have labels from a well-known company. This highlights the need for a shift in public perception. While we have introduced good governance practices, the country cannot move forward without a fundamental transformation in mind-set.",
      "",
      "Key figures like Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister Economic Development Dr. Anil Jayanth Fernando, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Deputy Minister of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development Chathuranga Abeysinghe, and Senior Presidential Advisor on Economic Affairs Duminda Hulangamuwa, along with officials from Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, participated in this event."

      "The president expressed these views during an event held yesterday (27) at the Customs Department Auditorium to mark International Customs Day under the theme, \u2018Customs Delivering on its Commitment to Efficiency, Security and Prosperity.\u2019",
      "The Customs Co-operation Council (CCC), established in 1952 with the participation of 17 European countries is independent intergovernmental body whose mission is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Customs administrations. This council quickly became globally recognized, and Sri Lanka became a member in 1967. In 1994, the Customs Cooperation Council was renamed the World Customs Organization (WCO).",
      "The first session of the Customs Cooperation Council was held on January 26, 1953, in Brussels, Belgium, marking the establishment of International Customs Day. As a result, every year on January 26, customs administration institutions across the world celebrate International Customs Day.",
      "The President also mentioned that necessary actions are being taken to create a modern organizational structure, with structural reforms being implemented within Sri Lanka Customs, the Department of Excise, and the Department of Inland Revenue.",
      "The President stated that laws and institutions must evolve to meet the challenges of the times and cannot remain static or permanent indefinitely.",
      "Elaborating further, President Disanayake shared the following insights:\nCustoms successfully fulfilled its responsibilities over the past year, and its efforts in stabilizing the economy are highly commendable. The achievements in meeting last year\u2019s targets are being appropriately recognized.",
      "However, simply achieving revenue targets is not enough to rebuild a collapsed economy. Addressing the economic crisis requires increasing the revenue-to-GDP ratio. The economic collapse has significantly disrupted the import-export market.",
      "All of our actions are currently being carried out within the parameters set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While surface-level indicators may suggest economic recovery, the overall economy remains deeply damaged. Therefore, it is essential to approach the recovery process cautiously and with balance. Even a small mistake can cause significant disruptions to the economy. Therefore, the Customs Department must work collectively to achieve its targeted revenue of Rs. 2,550 billion.",
      "A proposal has been submitted to improve facilities for Customs and establish a new salary structure. Discussions are underway with the Ministry of Finance and the Treasury to provide solutions.",
      "This year\u2019s budget has already addressed the increase in the basic salaries of public sector employees. Additionally, plans are in place to enhance the efficiency of the public service by integrating digitalization and technology. Efforts are also being made to implement legal reforms to build strong institutional frameworks.",
      "There were conflicts between previous political administrations and the state service mechanism. Due to these disagreements, the political leadership failed to implement the necessary reforms to strengthen institutional frameworks at the right time. It was a challenging period to establish robust institutional structures.",
      "The failure to introduce timely institutional changes resulted in the expected outcomes not being achieved. Consequently, before we could secure many opportunities for ourselves, external parties took advantage of our resources. As a result, Sri Lanka missed several opportunities to leverage its natural strategic position as a nation.",
      "In the future, necessary measures must be taken to facilitate operations at the Sri Lanka Port, targeting a capacity of 11.3 million containers. Achieving this will require collective effort from all employees. Without such unity, the country cannot move forward. This year, the Customs Department has been assigned a revenue target of LKR 2,550 billion.",

However, it had not convened between 1992 and 2020, and even in 2020, no significant decisions were implemented. This meeting in 2025 marks the resumption of the committee\u2019s activities after a gap of 28 years, making it a notable milestone.",

He also engaged in detailed discussions about the issues faced by state institutions, including Sri Lanka Customs, as well as the challenges encountered by port service providers. While emphasizing the necessity of implementing short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans for port sector development, the President underscored the urgent need for a joint effort by all parties to address the current crisis. As a result, both public and private sector stakeholders agreed to work together towards an immediate resolution.",
      "To expedite the clearance process, Sri Lanka Customs officers agreed to operate continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, a 5-acre plot of land in the Bloemendhal Disanayake area was allocated for storing containers pending investigation, with plans to release 2 acres by January 31 and the remaining portion by February 28. Addressing the issue of congestion caused by idle container vehicles at port terminals, the government agreed to provide land in the Peliyagoda area for parking these vehicles, thereby easing the traffic at the terminals.",
      "Further, delays caused by regulatory agencies such as the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), the Department of Food Commissioner, and the Plant Quarantine Division were highlighted during the discussion. It was revealed that staff shortages in these institutions were a significant factor contributing to the delays. In response, the President directed the relevant authorities to fill these vacancies promptly and to enhance welfare allowances for the officers of these institutions to ensure a more efficient clearance process.",
      "Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation, Bimal Ratnayake, stated that if there are any financial requirements related to this process, they can be provided by the Ministry of Ports. Additionally, private associations requested the President to take disciplinary action against clerical staff who fail to report for duty on time during the container clearance process. The Minister further emphasized that it is the responsibility of the respective private companies to ensure that their employees report to work promptly.",
      "Importers agreed that food-related products must be accompanied by mandatory certificates issued by foreign laboratories following proper testing, and in the event of any violations, appropriate legal action will be taken in accordance with government regulations. A decision was made to reduce the period during which containers can be stored within the port premises without charge to two days. Furthermore, it is anticipated that this period will be further reduced to one day starting from June.\nMinister Ratnayake also noted that this expedited clearance process would continue until June 30 and stressed the need for all stakeholders, including the port, customs, and private service providers, to work together as one unified team.",

This platform aims to facilitate the commercialization of research and development, thereby contributing to sustainable economic growth through the production of value-added goods and services, which will ultimately drive national economic development and social progress.",
      "The President pointed out that while grassroots-level innovators do emerge in Sri Lanka, there has been a lack of adequate mechanisms to properly support, nurture, and commercialize their ideas. He stressed the need to create an enabling environment for free and innovative thinking, backed by an efficient system to channel these ideas into productive outcomes. With such a framework in place, Sri Lanka can transform itself into a hub of innovation.\nHistorically, the country has allocated a mere 0.12% of its annual GDP for research and development. Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s abundance of natural resources, there has been limited focus on utilizing research to generate economic benefits. However, with the new government in place, a significant number of local and international investors have shown keen interest in investing in Sri Lanka. The government aims to capitalize on this momentum by efficiently managing investments to spur economic growth without delay.",
      "The recently established Ministry of Science and Technology has already begun implementing a long-term, well-structured R&D strategy. The immediate priority will be to convert near-complete or completed research projects into marketable, value-added products and services, providing a quick boost to the economy.\nTo support this effort, the \u201cNational Initiative for R&D Commercialization (NIRDC)\u201d has been established, chaired jointly by the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, and Senior Advisor to the President, Prof. Gomika Udugamasooriya. The initiative includes a committee comprising experts from diverse fields such as scientific research, industry, economics, law, arts, and indigenous heritage.",
      "During the event, President Disanayake highlighted that while human needs remain constant, the methods of fulfilling those needs evolve. He noted that innovation and new product development are key to shaping those new methods.",
      "Addressing past shortcomings, the President observed that Sri Lanka\u2019s outdated approach to technology and innovation has hindered its ability to compete in the global market. Despite technological advancements driving a shift in global market trends, Sri Lanka remains trapped in traditional sectors like tea, coconut, and rubber.\nPresident Disanayake further underscored that globally leading companies have succeeded by integrating innovation with technology, noting that five out of the world\u2019s top ten companies are technology-based.",
      "He pointed out Sri Lanka\u2019s past neglect of technology as a key economic driver, contrasting it with developed countries that prioritized technological advancements and achieved significant economic growth.",
      "The President concluded by stating that eradicating poverty is essential not only to eliminate social suffering but also to restore the rights of marginalized communities. He asserted that through innovation, the rural poor can be empowered by ensuring their right to economic participation and access to information, which will ultimately improve their quality of life.",
      "Expressing his views, Senior Advisor to the President, Prof. Gomika Udugamasooriya stated:",
      "Up to now, research and development (R&D) outcomes in Sri Lanka have not been effectively integrated into the economy. Under this new program, efforts will be directed towards commercializing R&D, enabling economic growth and fostering social development to build a sustainable economy.",
      "The event was graced by a distinguished gathering, including Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Ministers Sunil Handunnetti and Wasantha Samarasinghe, Professor Anil Jayantha Fernando and Professor Chrishantha Abeysena, Deputy Ministers Chathuranga Abeysinghe, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Mr. Russel Apponsu, university vice-chancellors and representatives, heads of state and private research institutions, investors, entrepreneurs, industrialists, and senior executives from banks and financial institutions."

Despite decades of similar beginnings, have we truly embraced renewal for the betterment of our nation? Or have we regressed, adapting only to perpetuate past failures? This question confronts us as we welcome the New Year. Our firm resolution is to usher in transformative change for our country this year. This is both our challenge and responsibility, and we are fully committed to fulfilling it.",
      "Together with my cabinet, deputy ministers, and the entire political leadership, we are dedicated to this cause. This year marks the start of a new political culture in our country, as we lay the necessary foundations for its development. We aim to abolish practices such as nepotism, the abuse of power against the people, and the creation of a political elite that prioritizes personal interests over the public good. Instead, we are committed to a political culture aligned with the aspirations of the people.",
      "Economically, we recognize the severe challenges our nation has faced in recent years, leading to a state of near-collapse. Over the past year, we achieved some stability on the surface level of the economy and officially emerged from bankruptcy in the latter half of the year. This progress is owed to the immense efforts of officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the political leadership. However, surface-level stability is not enough. This year, we will implement an economic policy framework aimed at addressing the deeper structural problems within our economy.",
      "Our country has also faced various security threats over the years. It is with great confidence that we can now assure our citizens of a robust and secure national defence. Last year, reports surfaced regarding a potential attack cantered on Arugam Bay. Our police, intelligence services, and armed forces acted decisively to maintain the nation\u2019s security and instil public trust. We have also begun systematically reinstating the rule of law, which had been neglected for far too long. In the past, criminals, corrupt individuals, and even political authorities operated above the law, disregarding constitutional principles. In some instances, former presidents were found guilty of constitutional violations by the Supreme Court. In such a context, the rule of law had become merely an abstract notion.",
      "To re-establish and strengthen the rule of law, we are making significant efforts. Our country has been plagued by widespread corruption, malpractice, and inefficiency within the state apparatus, political institutions, and society as a whole. Corruption has become a malignant cancer spreading throughout our nation, and eliminating it requires a tremendous collective effort. The Attorney General\u2019s Department has a critical role to play in this endeavour, and I trust they will perform their duties with the necessary diligence and support.",
      "Similarly, institutions such as the Criminal Investigation Department and the judiciary bear the principal responsibility for transforming our country into one free from corruption and fraud. We believe these institutions will act with the dedication required to achieve this transformation. As political leaders, we are committed to setting an example through both our words and actions.",
      "However, leadership and intervention from the political sphere alone will not suffice. Relevant state institutions must understand their responsibilities and contribute actively to this process of change.",
      "Therefore, I call upon all relevant institutions and officials to provide their unwavering support. This collective effort is vital for the transformative progress our nation needs in the coming year.",
      "To construct any strong building or initiate any successful project, a solid foundation is essential. Our nation, however, is one that has lost its foundation, its very groundwork. For this reason, we have focused our initial efforts on successfully establishing the fundamental groundwork required to rebuild this country. This foundation encompasses political authority, state mechanisms, the rule of law, respect for and protection of the Constitution, and a rejection of corruption, fraud, and bribery. These elements form the bedrock necessary to advance the nation. We are rapidly and systematically laying this foundation. The benefits of the robust economy built on this foundation must flow to our citizens.",
      "Our government is focusing on three main projects, or key objectives, to lead this initiative. The first priority is to rescue our country and its people. Economic reforms are being formulated to ensure that economic benefits reach rural communities, as an economy concentrated in the hands of a small group can never bring stability to society. Such an imbalanced economy fosters instability for the nation and its people. Therefore, achieving economic stability requires extending economic benefits to rural populations.",
      "With the upcoming budget, we aim to steer economic programs toward the eradication of poverty in our nation. Our second goal is to embrace digital transformation. By establishing a foundation for digitalization, we seek to minimize inefficiency and corruption while enabling citizens to interact seamlessly and effectively with state mechanisms.",
      "The third major initiative is the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d project. This endeavour goes beyond merely cleaning up the environment. It aspires to restore the deeply eroded and deteriorated social and environmental fabric of our motherland. We aim to create cleanliness and rejuvenation across all sectors of society.",
      "Allow me to highlight a few critical issues to emphasize the importance of these efforts. Sri Lanka is endowed with an exceptionally beautiful and vital environment. Our strategic geographic location is a significant advantage, and visitors often remark on the stunning beauty of our country. However, despite this natural wealth, Sri Lanka faces grave challenges.",
      "In 2023 alone, 181 people lost their lives in human-elephant conflicts, and 484 elephants were killed by human action. Although we possess an aesthetically and ecologically rich environment, we are a nation where 484 elephants die annually. Furthermore, floods and landslides displace significant populations; resulting in loss of life, and cause substantial economic damage.",
      "Restoring our environmental system must become a core focus of the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d program. Our nation and its people need a new value system. We have mistakenly elevated incorrect values to positions of importance, embedding them as the fundamental ethos of our society. It is crucial to establish a new framework of values.",
      "Where do we begin? The first step must be cultivating an appreciation for one\u2019s own life. Sadly, many of our citizens lack a sense of self-worth or value for their lives. I say this because, in the past year, 550 people drowned, whether in the sea, reservoirs, wells, or ponds. A total of 2,321 people died due to such incidents. These figures highlight the urgent need to foster respect for life in our society.",
      "On average, approximately seven people lose their lives daily due to road accidents in our country. This reflects the emergence of a society that lacks a sense of value for life; one where individuals have little regard for their own lives or the lives of others. It is a society devoid of empathy, concern, and consideration for one another.",
      "Therefore, it is essential to heal our society and introduce a new system of values and principles. Under the \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 Initiative, we aim to establish these new values and systems. Minimizing road accidents is a priority. To achieve this, my trust lies first and foremost in the citizens rather than the law. Citizen participation and engagement are vital. If citizens fail to comply, we are prepared to enforce the law. However, we are committed to driving this transformation with a thoughtful, inclusive and adaptive approach. Nonetheless, if any one obstructs this progress, we are equally ready to act decisively and assertively to ensure the recovery and well-being of our society.",
      "Furthermore, it is essential to address the concerns of our citizens regarding the safety and quality of the food they purchase from the market. As a state, it is our responsibility to provide food that is free from harmful substances.",
      "The Clean Sri Lanka initiative encompasses the responsibility to act towards these goals. Furthermore, as a society, we must care for our citizens, including those with disabilities. This is a matter of social justice. Can we marginalize individuals simply because they have grown old? Can we exclude those with disabilities from society, treating them as outsiders instead of equals? A society that does so can never truly be considered a just or compassionate one. If we lack empathy and compassion for the disabled community, the elderly, and the women and youth in our midst, we fail to nurture and uphold a sense of collective care. Such a society will become one characterized by cruelty and indifference toward one another. Therefore, we must cultivate a new social mind-set that prioritizes inclusivity and compassion.",
      "Additionally, the protection of public assets is vital. For a long time, Sri Lankan citizens held a deep respect for public property. However, in recent times, there has been a shift where people protect their personal possessions but neglect the preservation of national resources and public goods. This stems from a lack of understanding about the intrinsic value of these shared assets.",
      "A state must ensure that all citizens recognize the importance of safeguarding national resources\u2014not just for their benefit but for the benefit of future generations. These resources are not exclusively ours to exploit or destroy. Our generation has a responsibility to protect and preserve them for those who will come after us.",
      "It is within this framework that the Clean Sri Lanka initiative is prepared to act. Moreover, we understand that the government machinery and political authorities must function with efficiency and urgency. Every citizen must take responsibility for fulfilling their respective duties to ensure the success of this collective vision.",
      "If responsibility is neglected, the weight of that responsibility will inevitably cause the system to collapse. The strength and stability of this structure are built upon various frameworks, including government, political, and private sectors. When members of these frameworks fail to fulfill their assigned responsibilities, it leads to significant harm to the system as a whole. Therefore, we urge, particularly from the state sector, to be prepared to uphold your duties with diligence and commitment. Numerous examples today highlight the importance of responsibility and selfless service. Many critical institutions in Sri Lanka, vital to economic progress and national security, are led by individuals who voluntarily take on significant responsibilities.",
      "The Chairperson of Sri Lankan Airlines, the Chairperson of Sri Lanka Telecom, the Chairperson of the Port City, the Chairperson of the Board of Investment, and the Chairperson of the Gas Company, among many others, are professionals with exceptional skills and expertise. These individuals have stepped into their roles within our institutions to serve voluntarily, without any personal financial gain. Additionally, on a personal level, I have three advisors who also contribute their knowledge and expertise without receiving a single rupee as remuneration from the government.",
      "On a personal note, my own three advisors work without receiving a single rupee in compensation from the government. These examples of selfless dedication serve as powerful reminders of the impact individuals can make when they place national progress above personal gain.",
      "Sri Lanka is fortunate to have some of its most brilliant minds contributing voluntarily to national progress. Among them is a distinguished expert in digital transformation with extensive experience in the field. Having conducted ground-breaking research in science and technology at a leading American university, this individual is now working selflessly for the betterment of our nation.",
      "Similarly, an expert with practical experience in economics, who has accumulated invaluable insights, has chosen to dedicate their time and expertise voluntarily. These are the kind of leaders our country needs\u2014visionaries with fresh perspectives and transformative ideas. They are not driven by monetary gain or personal benefit but by the desire to serve the nation. These individuals have set aside their prestigious careers and dedicated their knowledge, time, and effort to rebuild our country, serving as an extraordinary example of selflessness and commitment.",
      "A remarkable example has been set for our country. Because of this, I am telling you that we have been given an opportunity to rise. I do not consider this the final opportunity, because there are no \u201cfinal moments\u201d for people there are only opportunities. Today, as a nation, as a country, we have the chance to rise.",
      "What I ask of the citizens of this country is this: Will you let this opportunity slip away, or will you seize it with determination and use it to rebuild our country and our nation? Are you ready to fulfil your duties and contribute to this cause? This is the question I am asking you.",
      "Is this responsibility solely that of the government? Is it just a political manifesto? No. This is a collective effort. Throughout history, various nations around the world have faced challenges at different times. I don\u2019t believe that any nation has ever gone through its journey without facing challenges from the beginning to the present. Every country has faced its unique set of challenges at various points in time. However, in each case, the political leadership, state machinery, and collective effort of the citizens have come together to overcome these challenges.",
      "We don\u2019t need to go far back in history. If we think of just the last century, we can see how many countries in Asia rose up in unity based on the message of collective effort. But what have we done? Instead of rising together, we have fostered distrust among ourselves, allowing nationalism, religious extremism, and divisive political battles to undermine our society. We\u2019ve let mistrust, anger, and hatred grow among us through divisive politics. If the people are never ready to rise together, we will never have the chance to overcome these challenges. Therefore, the opportunity has presented itself. We now have the chance to rise up and take this opportunity.",
      "We are ready to put an end to all divisions. As people born in the same Sri Lanka, we are prepared to come together and work collectively to build this country. Therefore, especially the success of the \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 program will depend solely on the active participation of the people. Without that, this cannot be achieved merely by laws imposed by the government or by officials appointed by the government. It is only through the collective effort of the public that we can make this a success.",
      "A government mechanism is needed for this. Already, a task force of about 18 individuals has been appointed towards this end. I want to emphasize that everyone is working voluntarily. Furthermore, we hope to establish a Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat for this purpose. We also aim to form a Clean Sri Lanka Council to bring the people together for this cause, throughout the country. Ultimately, this is not a project that will conclude at a specific time. It is a continuous program that adapts to new global circumstances and is a part of the effort to restore governance within society. This is not a one or two-year project. If it were a project, it would be something that could be completed in one place, but the world is rapidly changing, and significant global victories are being achieved.",
      "Social values, new principles, and fresh systems are continuously evolving. All of these elements are contributing to the formation of a new Sri Lankan nation in this country. For this cause, we are establishing a separate fund to support this effort. Citizens of this country will have the opportunity to contribute to this fund. The Ministry of Finance has appointed a supervisory board to oversee it. Therefore, this work is a collective effort that we must carry out to succeed, and we invite everyone to join in. By working together, we can accomplish this with great success. May this year be a prosperous new year for everyone.\nThank you very much."

      "Press Statement on the Economic Stabilization Process and Relief Packages to people.",
      "1. Economic Stabilization\nEconomic stabilization is key to take the country out of abyss created by past regimes. At the time the government assumed office those who are responsible for the crisis had unilaterally suspended external debt servicing in April 2022, entered into IMF program for Extended fund facility (EFF) of approximately USD 3 billion over a period of 4 years to be received in 8 installments, and paddled through the IMF program and debt restructuring process connected to in in line with debt sustainability analysis connected to it. The delayed and complex nature of the debt restructuring process incurred additional costs to the country and created additional burdens on the people. However after, considering both pros and cons of the context prevailed at that time in terms of social, political and economic perspective, the government proceeded with the options in the best interest of the people of the country.",
      "Accordingly, it was possible to reach the staff-level agreement of the third review on 26th November 2024, in line with the program parameters, and government revenue measures with appropriate engagement, and timely facilitation. In the lead-up to the board approval from the IMF, the government is engaging with necessary stakeholders to obtain the next tranche of the EFF.",
      "Debt Restructuring\nIt consists of both domestic and external restructuring. Domestic debt restructuring was completed in July 2023. External restructuring excludes multilateral creditors on various ground and arguments. The rest consists of official bilateral debt and private ISB holders.",
      "Bilateral Debt\nThe bilateral debt is delt with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) co-chaired by France, India and Japan representing 17 countries, China Exim Bank, China Development bank, other official creditors (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan) and other commercial creditors.\nOCC had agreed to the terms and conditions in June 2024 and the loans with China Exim bank had already been restructured in October 2023 within the agreed framework, ensuring comparability of treatment (CoT). Except the other official creditors (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan) accounting roughly USD 300 million representing about 1% total external debt subject restructuring , all other bilateral creditors have already agreed for restructuring within the agreed framework.",

Ad Hoc Group (AHG) and Local banking consortium represent ISBs which account for USD 14.2 billion including a past due interest of USD 1.7 billion.",
      "By prioritizing and facilitating actions in a timely manner, the new government has demonstrated a strong political commitment to steering the country toward economic stability. These efforts toward financial stability have been independently acknowledged by third parties, including rating agencies which have upgraded the ratings by several notches, which was only possible due to the correct prioritization and implementation of economic stabilization measures. Hence, the government continued with the restructuring process and facilitated it to ensure the successful completion of the issuance of new bonds for the exchange of existing ones on 20th December 2024 in order to achieve the critical objective of stabilizing the economy in pursue of navigating the country with the growth and development trajectory towards a thriving nation and beautiful life.\n________________________________________\n2.

Based on data provided by the Central Bank, 99% of borrowers with outstanding capital of less than 25 million rupees in restructured loans have been granted a 12-month extension to renegotiate with banks and agree on a settlement path. Borrowers with debts between 25,000,000 and 50,000,000 rupees have been granted a 9-month extension, while all other borrowers are entitled to a 6-month extension. This relief package, proposed by the government and to beimplemented through the Central Bank, also includes several other important measures, such as easing the credit rating status, extending the repayment period, offering low interest rates for restructured debt, and providing a transparent mechanism to resolve valuation disputes.",

Children in the Aswesuma Families\nTo ease the burden on parents from vulnerable groups in society, Rs. 6,000 per child has been allocated to purchase essential school books and stationery for the upcoming school term. Children from Aswesuma recipient families will begin receiving this benefit shortly.",
      "2.b.2. Children Not Receiving Aswesuma\nChildren from families who are not currently receiving Aswesuma but are facing economic hardship will also be provided with this benefit, based on recommendations from the Ministry of Education. It is expected that the process will be finalized soon, and the disbursement scheme will start within a few days, ensuring that all deserving children facing economic hardship receive assistance."

      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake highlighted the critical challenge of transforming Sri Lanka\u2019s public service into an efficient state mechanism. He pointed out that the newly appointed committee tasked with reviewing state institutions would make decisions without being influenced by political pressures.",
      "The President shared these views while addressing the District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries conference today (20)) at the Ministry of Home Affairs Auditorium, located in the \u201cNila Medura\u201d building in Narahenpita.",
      "President Dissanayake noted that the public service, which has undergone multiple name changes from Government Agents to District Secretaries, boasts a history of nearly 200 years. He emphasized its pivotal role in steering the country towards a new direction.",
      "However, the President stated that the current situation is far from satisfactory regarding the ultimate goals and objectives. He noted that the public has no trust in receiving fair services from state institutions and emphasized that the entire system has collapsed as a functioning state mechanism.",
      "The President asserted that both political authorities and the public service must ask themselves whether they are prepared to restore the broken system.",
      "He clarified that his focus was not on the positions within public service but rather on who occupies those positions and their ability to lead effectively. He also highlighted the lack of dynamic leadership in certain sectors, a gap he aims to address by providing training for 1,500 officials in India, as agreed upon during his recent visit.",
      "Additionally, the government intends to grant scholarships for higher education abroad to a significant number of students who pass the Advanced Level examinations next year.\nPresident Dissanayake questioned the basis on which some institutions and positions were established and reiterated the challenge of transforming the public service into an efficient state mechanism. This, he noted, requires a new framework.",
      "He reaffirmed the commitment to reviewing state institutions through the newly established committee, which will make impartial decisions uninfluenced by political interference. While there is no intention to downsize the public service, the President acknowledged concerns about the high expenditure involved in maintaining it. He advocated for reforms to make the system more efficient and structured.",
      "President Dissanayake also stressed the importance of re-evaluating community-based projects and announced plans to expedite the Digital Identity Card initiative and launch the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d project starting January 01st, 2025.",
      "He assured his full political support for these initiatives while emphasizing that their success depends on the contribution of public officials. Noting that 80% of the mandate rests on government employees, the President emphasized the need for harmony and mutual accountability between political authorities and government employees.",
      "Accordingly, the President stated that previous mandates have demonstrated alignment between the expectations and goals of political authorities and the public service. He added that both sides are in agreement on the tasks at hand.",
      "The President also noted plans to implement several projects under three key areas: eradicating poverty, digital transformation, and reshaping societal attitudes through the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d project. These efforts aim to elevate the country to a new level.",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that he would stand in defense of any official who faces challenges, injustice, or unfair treatment while working towards these goals. However, he warned that any deliberate efforts by an official to obstruct or neglect these tasks would be met with equally firm action.",
      "The event was attended by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya; Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Dr. A.H.M.H. Abeyrathne, Deputy Minister P. Ruwan Senarath, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister G.

    "article_title": "Will Ensure that the 2022-23 Crisis Never Recurs in Our Country",
    "article_body_paragraphs": [
      "\u2013 President says addressing Parliament",
      "\u201cYesterday, we engaged in a robust three-hour debate on debt restructuring. That discussion provided an opportunity to outline the roadmap that has led us to the current stage and to highlight the achievements we have made thus far. I will not delve into lengthy explanations, but I must address a narrative being propagated, a narrative that seeks to instill fear by suggesting that Sri Lanka may face bankruptcy again in 2028. Let me state firmly: under our leadership, we will never allow a situation like 2022-23 to reoccur in our country. In 2028, this government will still be in power, and we will have achieved stability and resilience.\nWe are confident in our goal of increasing Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to USD 15.1 billion by 2028. This is not just an aspiration; it is a commitment that we are diligently working to fulfill.",
      "I also observed that many individuals, when presenting their views on this matter, spoke in an advisory tone and provided extensive information. As of today, we have restructured USD 12.55 billion in debt, including USD 1.7 billion of defaulted debt. Out of this USD 12.55 billion, USD 11.5 billion was borrowed during the 2015\u20132019 administration.",
      "If those who now speak in an advisory tone had provided guidance back then, this country would not have ended up in bankruptcy. Therefore, advice delayed is advice wasted. The true value of advice lies in providing it at the right moment. Consequently, the advice being offered now holds no validity.\nThe second review with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was successfully concluded, and the second tranche of funds was released. When we assumed office, the third review had been delayed. It was only in September that the third review was initiated. During the election period, the previous administration had not prepared for the third review.",
      "Accordingly, immediately after the conclusion of the general election, on November 16, we began the third review discussions with the IMF. During the second review, several preconditions and agreements were reached by the previous government. One such agreement was the imposition of a property tax based on imputed income. This tax is scheduled to be implemented in 2025, as agreed upon during the second review.\nDuring the second review, an agreement was reached to impose a fixed 30% tax on service exports. Additionally, it was proposed to eliminate the Special Commodity Levy by January and replace it with Value Added Tax (VAT).",
      "The Special Commodity Levy is a mechanism used in our country to protect local producers by adjusting taxes, either increasing or decreasing them as necessary. However, during the second review, it was agreed to abolish this levy and replace it with VAT. Furthermore, it was decided to maintain the existing tax-exempt thresholds for personal income unchanged.",
      "By April 2025, an agreement was also reached to simplify and remove the Surcharge VAT. Businesses in our country face significant challenges in obtaining VAT refunds, which affects their operations. The Surcharge VAT had enabled businesses to maintain necessary cash flow, but proposals have now been prepared to eliminate it.",
      "Relief for Professionals through PAYE Adjustments",
      "During the initiation of the third review, we decided to reduce the burden of the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) tax imposed on professionals in our country. There was significant dissatisfaction regarding this tax among professionals such as university academics, doctors, and bank officials.\nFollowing discussions, we were able to increase the tax-free threshold from LKR 100,000 to LKR 150,000. Additionally, the first band of the Personal Income Tax (PIT), taxed at 6%, was extended from LKR 600,000 to LKR 01 million. Accordingly:",
      "\u2022 An individual earning a monthly income of LKR 150,000 pays zero tax.\n\u2022 An individual earning LKR 200,000 is exempted from 71% of the tax they would have otherwise paid.\n\u2022 An individual earning LKR 250,000 is exempted from 61% of the tax.\n\u2022 An individual earning LKR 300,000 is exempted from 47% of the tax.\n\u2022 An individual earning LKR 350,000 is exempted from 25.5% of the tax.",
      "What does this mean? We have successfully provided greater relief to lower-income earners while offering reduced benefits to higher-income earners, achieving a fair and balanced outcome through this review.",
      "Exemptions and Reductions for yoghurt and milk products",
      "To improve the nutritional standards of our children, we have exempted yogurt and other dairy products from Value Added Tax (VAT). Additionally, the export service tax rate, previously set by the previous government at 30%, has been reduced to 15%.\nAn agreement was reached to increase the withholding tax from 5% to 10%. Many ordinary elderly citizens and retirees rely on interest income from their deposits for their livelihood. Typically, if someone earns monthly interest exceeding LKR 150,000, they will become subject to this tax.",
      "However, if any citizen believes they should not be subjected to this tax, they can approach the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and present their case regarding their tax status. A dedicated unit will be established within the IRD to assist individuals in clarifying their tax obligations and ensuring exemptions where applicable.\nThe primary objective here is to provide relief to retirees and individuals relying on fixed deposit income, ensuring that no one faces undue hardship. At the same time, we aim to broaden the tax base and enhance the tax mechanism\u2019s efficiency.",
      "Systematically Opening the Vehicle Market",
      "Attention has also been directed toward systematically reopening the country\u2019s vehicle market. This market includes a range of industries and entrepreneurs dependent on its operations, making it unsustainable to keep it closed indefinitely. Consequently, the vehicle import market will be reopened in three phases:\n1. Passenger transport buses and vehicles for special purposes were reopened for import on December 14.\n2. Private vehicles will be allowed for import starting February next year.",
      "Concerns about triggering a dollar crisis are unwarranted. Extensive discussions have been held with the Central Bank, and estimates have been prepared regarding the amount of dollars expected to be allocated for these imports. These calculations ensure that the economy can sustain the impact.\nTo rejuvenate our economy, reopening the vehicle market is an essential step.",
      "The grace period for the Parate law extended",
      "The deadline for the Parate law was set to end on the 15th of December. However, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have not yet fully returned to normal conditions, so we hope to extend the grace period further. Our study revealed that 99% of loan defaulters owe less than LKR 25 million. Therefore, we have devised a plan. If the Parate law is completely suspended, it could cause a crisis in the banking system. Since people\u2019s money is in the banking system, we must ensure the security of the banking system. The collapse of large financial institutions has caused immense hardship for the people. Depositors have committed suicide, and as a result, it is the people who have faced the consequences of the collapse of financial institutions. Therefore, in making decisions, we have considered both protecting the banking system and safeguarding small and medium-sized enterprises. Hence, we are working to extend the Parate law until March 31, 2025. During discussions with bank loan holders, a deadline of December 31 has been given to restructure their loans. Those with loans between LKR 25 million and LKR 50 million, excluding interest, can also negotiate loan restructuring with banks.",
      "For those with loans over LKR 50 million, excluding interest, the deadline for loan restructuring has been extended until June 2025. Before that, they will have the opportunity to approach the bank for loan restructuring. We hope to provide some relief to these individuals in the upcoming budget. The proposals in the budget are expected to be implemented by April next year. Some of these will require legal amendments. Since October, the pensioners\u2019 allowance has been increased by LKR 3,000, and the fertilizer subsidy has been increased to LKR 25,000. Instructions have been given to the Ministry of Finance to ensure that this fertilizer subsidy is delivered to farmers without delay.",
      "Monthly Allowance of 6,000 for Underprivileged students",
      "For children from schools in financial difficulties, a monthly allowance of 6,000 rupees is planned. Due to financial hardship, some children are not attending school, and funds have been allocated in this budget to provide the necessary support to those children. We hope to provide a monthly allowance of 6,000 rupees to these children. Additionally, we hope to include children who were previously excluded from the benefits in this scheme.",
      "The Aswesuma was initially planned to be distributed in four categories. Of these, 800,000 people are expected to be dropped from the Aswesuma project by the 31st of December. We have extended the benefits for the lower categories of these two groups until March, and for the remaining categories, the benefits have been extended until December next year. There are some disagreements in the villages about who should receive the Aswesuma and who should not. Therefore, we have reviewed the Aswesuma distribution process. We will re-examine the information received through the system and ensure that those who are eligible for the Aswesuma, but have not yet received it, will be included.",
      "The decision to distribute the Aswesuma in our country was made through the banking system. Normally, opening an account in a bank in our country requires an identity card. However, there are still people who have not been able to receive their Aswesuma for over a year because they are unable to open a bank account, even though they are entitled to the Aswesuma. These are issues that need to be closely addressed by the authorities. We have decided to provide time for people who do not have an identity card to open a bank account. We will ensure that the Aswesuma is granted not from the day they acquire their identity card but from the day they are eligible.\nThe discussions on the budget are expected to conclude by March 21. There are several amendments required to be made to the Aswesuma Act, and we hope for your cooperation in this regard.\u201d"

Whether the mistake occurs within the country or at any level within our government, we will not hesitate to take decisive action. Every necessary step will be taken at the appropriate time without delay.\u201d\nPresident Anura Kumara Dissanayake also reaffirmed his government\u2019s unwavering commitment to upholding the trust placed in them by the people, who have endured decades of deception. He pledged to work tirelessly to build a better nation.\nThe Minister of Health and Mass Media, Dr Nalinda Jayatissa, Director-General of Government Information, Harsha Bandara, and the heads of state media were present at the meeting."

    "article_body_paragraphs": [
      "I think the recent people\u2019s mandate has clearly demonstrated society\u2019s aspirations to all of us. On several occasions, the mandate by the people of our country has been conveyed in different ways. On some occasions, it has been given in the context of ending a war, while on other occasion, it has emerged as a significant component in ensuring democracy. I believe that the foremost priority of the 2024 mandate reflects the people\u2019s desire to combat bribery and corruption. Present here are officials from the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, police officers, representatives from the Attorney General\u2019s Department, and individuals from various other critical fields, including the judiciary. I am here in my capacity as a political representative.",
      "We are all empowered by the Constitution. The laws enacted by Parliament have conferred power upon each of us. These laws, along with regulations and circulars, have delegated authority. All of us have been entrusted with power within the Constitution and the law. However, all that power is derived from the sovereign authority of the people. Thus, the laws we adhere to, the limitations imposed upon us, above all that we are all subject to the mandate and sovereign power of the people.",
      "\u201cLet us become exemplary forbearers of a proud nation.\u201d This is what we aspire to be. Now, who is missing here? I am present as a political authority. The Secretary to the President, the Secretary to the Prime Minister, and other senior state officials are present. Justices of the Supreme Court are here. The Inspector General of Police and the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence are here. The Chairman and Commissioners of the Bribery or Corruption Commission are also present. So, who else is missing? Where, then, is the problem? If we observe this honestly, the issue lies here. How can a file in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) move up and down, or remain stuck for seven or eight years in a cupboard? Is this not where the problem lies?",
      "Please do not take my comments personally. The gravity of today\u2019s societal plight is undeniable. Consider the delay in file handling. How can a file referred by the CID remain inactive for seven years? Where is the root of the problem? How can a court case take seven to eight months to process or to receive a new date? Each institution might have its own explanation or justification in this regard. The CID may argue that the sheer number of complaints overwhelms their capacity and that they lack adequate officers to investigate and file cases properly. The Bribery Commission and the Attorney General\u2019s Department might offer similar reasoning. However, this issue is not external to us. If each of us fails to make a sincere effort, then we are the problem. Without personal integrity and commitment, we cannot become the \u201cexemplary forbearers\u201d we aspire to be. The question, therefore, is how will the general public hold us accountable? The core issue here is how we tackle bribery and corruption. I believe we must first examine our own conscience and actions. Let me assure you of one thing. As a political authority, I will use the powers entrusted to me fully and with utmost honesty to combat fraud and corruption. You can be confident of my unwavering commitment to this cause.",
      "But I know my limitations. I can provide the political leadership for that. I can provide the necessary infrastructure. I can allocate the necessary funds. But who should take the initiative? I believe it should be you.",
      "We are now ranked 115th. I think we are in this position because of the lack of accurate information. If precise information were available, our position might be higher. Recently, a series of investigations were carried out that drew global attention. One such case involves Imam Subheru, a CIA agent in the United States, who was sentenced under the Money Laundering Act. During the investigation, it was revealed that he had received USD 06 million from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). Presently there is a court case in the United States that involved the CBSL.",
      "Another significant case was heard in the High Court of England regarding Airbus Company offering bribes to officials in order to secure purchase of aircrafts in respective countries. This investigation conducted collaboratively by the United States, France and England. It was revealed that Airbus Company had also paid bribes to Sri Lankan Air Lines.",
      "A case was heard in the US where the Sri Lankan Ambassador was convicted under the Money Laundering Act for purchasing of a new embassy building. He admitted guilt. He apologized to the court.",
      "Moreover, when the Pandora Papers and Panama Papers were published, Sri Lankans also implicated there. In Australia, an investigation revealed that an Australian company had paid bribes while supplying medical equipment to the Hambantota Hospital. When the investigation is going on, Hambantota takes the spotlight.",
      "Let\u2019s set aside our country\u2019s internal issues for a moment. This has happened to our country. But have we managed to conduct thorough and fair investigations into such incidents? Have we held the real perpetrators accountable and delivered justice? The power we hold comes from the collective strength of the citizens of this country. It is through their hard work and wealth that we receive our salaries and privileges. But in return, have we upheld justice and fairness for them?",
      "No. What we are doing, in many instances, is repeatedly using the power entrusted to us to engage in corruption. The people have given this power for us. They have granted us privileges and provided us with salaries. But what do those entrusted with these responsibilities do? They misuse their power and privileges to engage in bribery and corruption repeatedly. That is the reality. Isn\u2019t that right?",
      "Power is meant to uphold justice. But instead, it is often used for injustice, personal gain and the accumulation of wealth. So, I ask, what is the true outcome of this power?",
      "Therefore, if we do not come to a firm and collective determination, acknowledging that the power we hold is derived from the people and must serve justice and fairness, then no matter what institutions we build or laws we create, they will have no meaningful impact.",
      "I am not suggesting that laws are unnecessary or that institutions should not be strengthened. If existing laws are insufficient, let us create more. If current institutions are inadequate, let us establish additional ones. But no matter how many laws we draft or institutions we build, they will amount to nothing if those who hold power are unwilling to carry out their duties and responsibilities.",
      "In my time, I have witnessed many people, to be honest, misusing their power. It is implausible that the Attorney General\u2019s Department has kept a file locked away for seven years. Similarly, it is unacceptable that certain files remain untouched from the day they are filed until they are deteriorated. Investigations by the CID should not drag on until the evidence and documents deteriorate. These are not mere institutional issues but reflect the misuse of authority entrusted to these entities. Without addressing such abuse, meaningful progress cannot be achieved.",
      "In 2021, 69 cases were concluded, and of these, 40 were withdrawn. Out of the 69 cases that were concluded, 40 have been withdrawn. Why was crucial evidence withheld in high-profile cases, such as the Malwana land case? Why are the officers who conducted investigations not listed as witnesses in certain cases? For example, Shani Abeysekara, as a key investigator, must testify. What happens to the credibility of a case when such critical witnesses are excluded?",
      "In 2022, 89 cases were filed, and 45 of them were withdrawn. If we are accountable to the citizens of our country, shouldn\u2019t we provide a clear explanation for this? Why is it that, in specific cases, the investigating officer is not listed as a witness? If we are truly bound to serve the people, we must clarify this. Why are cases being dismissed without calling witnesses in some instances? If we are committed to transparency, we must explain this to the public. Why are we withdrawing cases, and why is this not being communicated to the citizens? If documents have been stuck in drawers for seven or eight years, shouldn\u2019t we explain to the people why this is happening?",
      "Therefore, the entire system has collapsed as a unified structure. If we are to rebuild our country, this entire system must be restored. A small legal reform or minor institutional restructuring alone will not suffice to achieve this goal. At most, such measures might only take up five years of my time, but to truly transform the system, a comprehensive restoration is essential. Without that, achieving meaningful success will be impossible. Personally, I am striving to restore this entire system and turn the state into a well, functioning one. That is my aspiration. I firmly believe that if we fail to accomplish this at this critical moment, the people of our country will not even dare to dream of a prosperous state.",
      "If we fail to fulfil the hopes and expectations set by the people in this 2024 mandate, the citizens of our country will never even dream of a better future. People from North, East, Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim have come together, without division, to form a collective force driven by a shared purpose and hope. If we fail to achieve that purpose, I repeat, the people will never again pray for a better day.",
      "Therefore, we have a responsibility to fulfil this task. To carry out this responsibility, both I personally and our government are committed to properly executing our duties. However, your support is essential. If the institutions conducting investigations, those supporting them and the institutions reviewing and making decisions on those investigations do not actively contribute, we could continue to celebrate Anti-Corruption Day for many more decades. We can all gather with sincere intentions, participate in Anti-Corruption Day, and leave with applause for our participation only.",
      "But if we are ready to change, next year we can celebrate real progress, recognizing that this is something we can achieve. However, as our Chairman mentioned, the score in 2012 was 40. If it has decreased to 34 by 2024, should we celebrate the next day here, increasing the score? Should we continue celebrating as a corrupt state on December 9th?",
      "Since 2012, what has really happened as we commemorate each year? Each year, as we mark the occasion, the unfortunate reality is that corruption has escalated rather than diminished, while we celebrate on December 9th, which is fine, but I must emphasize that our right to celebrate stems not from the date itself, but from how well we have honoured the aspirations and expectations associated with it. If we fail to uphold these ideals, I believe that sitting down to commemorate the occasion next December will serve no purpose.",
      "Celebration, in my opinion, should be grounded in a renewed commitment and a decisive turning point. It should come from a deep sense of achievement. That is why I firmly believe that any commemoration we undertake must reflect tangible progress.",
      "Looking ahead, we must ask ourselves whether we can celebrate in a way that genuinely involves our citizens. Could this small hall gather enough people to truly celebrate? Yes, it is possible. However, for citizens to find meaning, devotion, respect, and value in such a commemoration, it is essential that we earn their trust through credible actions.",
      "Therefore, I am aware of the volume of complaints you handle. I understand the nature of those complaints. Remember, we have an idea of when those complaints were lodged and who the accused individuals are. But does the weight or lightness of a file depend on the name it contains? What difference does it make?",
      "Our Judge has emphasised that we must prioritize cases that significantly impact the economy and should expedite cases related to economic progress. However, I have the report dated March 06th.",
      "Let me remind you of an instance when then the Deputy Secretary of Parliament Mr. Iddawela made a parliamentary address, highlighting that in a single year, the Bribery Commission had punished only two Police Constables, a Grama Niladhari, an SI officer and a clerk. Two others were also convicted, though I can\u2019t recall their names now. This reflects a troubling reality: the law operates like a spider\u2019s web, trapping small offenders while allowing the powerful to escape.",
      "This is well-known to the citizens of this country. While there are individuals with extensive experience in law and legal processes, we all recognize that the public must regain trust in the fair enforcement of the law. Currently, such trust is lacking. Justice delayed, in effect, becomes justice denied. Justice must be delivered swiftly to uphold its true value. Therefore, I believe the time has come for us to question ourselves. Are we sincerely prepared to take on this responsibility with integrity?",
      "The decline of institutions is not a result of your own intensions or on natural circumstances but of an unpleasant political culture that has eroded their fundamental values. I am aware that the former Director General of the Bribery Commission was summoned to the Presidential Secretariat. If you recall he was a Mr. Ranasinghe from Kurunegala. What happened was he was instructed to conduct an investigation about a Minister overnight. The confidence of citizens in institutional systems has been shattered, and institutions themselves have lost faith in their own authority. This deterioration is due to the corrosive effects of this political culture.",
      "While we may not reverse this situation entirely in a year or two, we are committed to making a meaningful effort. The next generation will not take up this fight; it is up to us. We must act as a generation that strives to bring about this change. Our responsibility is to lay the foundation for a positive transformation. As political authorities, we are ready to provide that initial effort.",
      "I request you as a group of experts to support us in this noble effort. If we here today fail to act, who will? Will a farmer living in a remote village such as Dehiattakandiya, or an ordinary citizen, take on this task? It is our responsibility, and if we do not fulfil it, no one will. Therefore, I believe you must fulfil the duties entrusted to you. Let us all work together to ensure that by December 9th next year, we will have added real value to this commemoration.",
      "Thank you all very much!"

    "article_body_paragraphs": [
      "Today is an exceptionally significant day in the history of our Parliament. For decades, political power in our country shifted back and forth between two main camps. However, during the last Presidential and General Elections, that political power was entrusted to a new camp, us. This marks a monumental moment in the history of Sri Lanka\u2019s Parliament.\nThis mandate is a comprehensive one, encompassing numerous key aspects. Under our country\u2019s established electoral system, this Parliament now includes the highest number of representatives ever elected under a singular mandate. This is a numerically significant achievement. However, beyond its quantitative value lies a qualitative strength: for the first time in a long while, the public mandate has brought about a political transformation that enabled the formation of a new government. People from all provinces\u2014North, South, East, and West\u2014representing diverse communities, contributed to this mandate.\nNo Room for Racism\nI believe that for an extended period, the political framework in our country, and the bases of political power, were often shaped along regional, ethnic, or religious lines. Such political divisions inevitably resulted in growing alienation among communities. Suspicion and mistrust between different groups grew. When racism becomes the cornerstone of a political ideology, the unavoidable outcome is the emergence of counter- racism from opposing groups. Racism in one part feeds and strengthens nationalism in another. This is a dynamic we have experienced throughout our country\u2019s political and social history.\nYet, today, all communities across all provinces have trusted us and granted us this power. It is with profound gratitude that I extend my deepest respect and thanks to the people who trusted us. At the same time, I also acknowledge that there are sections of the population that did not trust us but instead placed their faith in other political movements. They, too, are an integral part of this democratic process.\nAcceptance of a Multi-Party System\nThat is the Nature of Democracy. Democracy is not about uniting all people under a single party or a single ideology. The essence of democracy lies in the coexistence of diverse political ideologies and groups. It thrives on the presence of political factions with varying economic and political perspectives. As a democratic state, we do not advocate for one-party rule. Instead, we embrace multi-party politics as a core principle of our democratic framework.\nWe are fully aware that there is a significant portion of the population who did not vote for us. It is the responsibility of our government to represent and address the needs and aspirations of all\ncitizens, regardless of whether they voted for us or not. Our commitment is to fulfil the expectations of every citizen of this nation.\nElections create a contract between the people and us. This bond is formed when we present our policy statement and ideas, outlining how the country\u2019s future should be shaped. People who place their trust in these ideas cast their votes for us. With their votes, the people have fulfilled their part in this relationship by granting us the mandate to govern. Now, it is our turn to fulfil our part by serving the people.\nTherefore me and my government are fully committed to upholding this bond. We will ensure that this trust is never violated and that governance continues responsibly, always prioritizing the well-being of the people.\nDuring this election campaign, it became evident that despite our differences in province, culture, language, and religion, we came together for a shared purpose and united behind a common goal. This unity displayed during the elections signifies a powerful moment in building national harmony, which the people of our country have long yearned for.\nBuilding National Unity\nWhile we may hold diverse political opinions, I assure you with full responsibility that we will not allow a resurgence of divisive racist politics in our country. Similarly, no form of religious extremism will be permitted to take root. Our nation has endured immense suffering due to ethnic conflicts. This soil has been soaked with enough blood, and rivers have flowed with the tears of countless people. Mistrust, suspicion, and anger among communities have grown to alarming levels.\nAs representatives of this Parliament, our foremost responsibility is to ensure that our future generations inherit a nation free of such suffering. We owe it to them to create a state where such tragedies are not repeated.\nIn politics, we may have countless slogans and battle cries, whether they be about economy or democracy. However, I guarantee that no one will be allowed to use nationalist or religious rhetoric as a means to gain political power in this country.\nRestoring the Dignity of Parliament\nMoreover, this mandate reflects another significant aspiration of the people: the desire to transform the corrupt political culture that has taken root in this country over many years. I have been serving in this Parliament since the year 2000. I have represented this Parliament continuously for 24 years. However, over these years, I have witnessed first-hand its gradual decline. I have seen the erosion of public trust in this institution and experienced the deterioration of the respect once held for it, both within these chambers and among the general public.\nThe respect and honour once associated with this Parliament have steadily deteriorated. What was once a revered institution has now become an object of public distrust, hostility and contempt. It is seen as an adversary by the people, a body they feel disconnected from and disillusioned with. I do not believe that such a Parliament is fit to govern, lead, or wield the sovereign power of the people. A Parliament like that is no longer fit to exercise financial control on behalf of the people. Nor is it suitable to continue drafting laws on behalf of the public.\nSo, what must be done? The Parliament holds the central role in upholding the people\u2019s sovereignty and exercising their power. It is the primary institution responsible for creating laws for the benefit of the people. Therefore, it is imperative that Parliament does not drift further away from the people or lose its relevance to them. The primary mission of this Parliament must be to restore its dignity and uphold its superior status as an institution. At this critical juncture, restoring the dignity and supremacy of Parliament should be a top priority.\nToday, this Parliament includes a significant number of new members. This offers an opportunity to establish good practices swiftly and effectively. I believe our current Speaker, the parliamentary staff, and all elected members have a crucial role in revitalizing this Parliament. Together, we must re-establish it as a body that truly represents the people and regains the trust and respect it once commanded.\nThis Parliament will no longer remain a hidden chamber concealed from the public. Today, Parliament operates in alignment with advancements in modern technology and media, making every daily occurrence open to the public. It will no longer serve as a secretive or inaccessible centre shielded from public scrutiny. Instead, we are striving to transform this Parliament into a transparent and accessible institution for all citizens.\nAs representatives of the people, we must continually uphold the principle that everything we say, the way we behave, and the opinions we express are subject to public scrutiny. If anyone believes that being entrusted with power marks the end of accountability, they are mistaken. The public retains the authority to scrutinize us until the next transfer of power, the next electoral mandate. Therefore, I firmly believe that in the coming years, this Parliament has the potential to become one that successfully withstands public scrutiny. To achieve this, I look forward to the support and contributions of the Honourable Speaker and all Members of Parliament.\nCreating a Satisfactory Public Service\nFurthermore, we are aware that this election marks a historical milestone in Sri Lanka as the one where the highest number of public servants voted in favour of a single government. However, it is no secret that the general public does not hold a favourable perception of the state service in our country. There exists significant dissatisfaction and negative sentiments among the public towards state services. Similarly, many within the state service themselves feel dissatisfied and unfulfilled in their roles and professional lives.\nAs a result, we are faced with a dual challenge: an unsatisfied public and a discontented state service workforce. Our ultimate responsibility, therefore, is to establish a state service that satisfies both the citizens it serves and the individuals who work within it.\nThrough this mandate, the people have shown their support for the reforms and proposals we presented to establish a better, more efficient public service. We firmly believe that moving forward without a strong and effective public service is not possible. Across the world, whenever countries undergo significant transformations, both political leadership and the functionality of the public sector play a critical role in achieving success.\nNo matter how ambitious the goals and expectations of political leaders may be, those goals can only be realized if there is a well-structured and responsive public service to implement them. That is why we believe it is essential to rebuild a competent, people-centric public service that prioritizes the well-being of the citizens. The strong mandate we have received from public servants themselves underscores this need. We are fully focused on addressing this critical issue.\nBuilding a Democratic State\nMoreover, democracy and freedom are fundamental principles. Every citizen should feel free to practice their religion, speak their language, and live according to their cultural values without fear or discrimination. No one should feel that their beliefs, culture, or political affiliations make them targets of undue pressure or prejudice. While political changes may occur, individual identities and freedoms must always be respected.\nAs I have said before, different communities may have their unique identities, but freedom is a common right for all. It is our responsibility to create a democratic and Free State where every citizen can live without fear or suspicion. We assure you that we are fully committed to fulfilling this responsibility and will work tirelessly to ensure this vision becomes a reality.\nConfirming the Supremacy of the Rule of Law\nA key responsibility we face is reaffirming the supremacy of the rule of law in our country. The rule of law is not upheld solely by enacting legislation in this Parliament. While we have drafted progressive and robust laws through extensive discussions and debates within this institution, enacting laws is not sufficient. These laws must be implemented effectively, and the people must feel that justice is being upheld. Unfortunately, over time, public trust in the rule of law has eroded.\nPeople no longer believe that they can obtain justice by seeking redress through the legal system when wronged. Their confidence in the ability of the legal system to resolve injustices has diminished. This signifies a breakdown in public faith in the supremacy of law and order. Without strengthening this foundation, we cannot build a just and prosperous state. A well-functioning rule of law must be the cornerstone of a good governance system.\nTherefore, as a state, as a government, and under the leadership of the President, we must all adhere to the law. No politician, authority, or individual should place themselves above the law. Everyone must operate within its boundaries, and we must work to restore the public\u2019s trust in it. Importantly, this effort is not about pursuing personal vendettas or engaging in witch hunts. Every citizen has the right to engage in politics freely.\nDelivering justice to the victims and imposing punishments on the criminals\nBut there have been controversial crimes that must be addressed. If perpetrators believe that such crimes can be buried and forgotten over time, it only deepens the public\u2019s distrust in the legal system. To restore this trust, crimes that fuelled controversy must be thoroughly investigated, justice must be served to the victims, and the perpetrators must be held accountable. These incidents cannot simply become political rhetoric for campaigns, as has often happened in the past. History shows that no state that failed to achieve justice for such crimes has succeeded in progressing.\nI assure you that the crimes that fuelled controversy will be exposed, the perpetrators will face justice, and fairness will be ensured for the victims. We aim to establish a state where law, justice, and fairness prevail. If we fail to do so within this mandate, there is little point in dreaming of such a state in the future. Let us remember that the public mandate we have received is steeped in these expectations and yearnings for justice.\nThis mandate reflects the grief of families mourning their lost loved ones, the despair of friends of those murdered, and the cry for justice echoing throughout this country. If we fail to deliver justice, who else will? Who can we entrust this responsibility to? No one. If we do not fulfil this duty, the public\u2019s dreams of justice and fairness will wither away. I believe that without action, even the faintest hopes for justice will vanish in this nation.\nJustice and fairness must be re-established in this country. We must address not only these crimes but also the corruption and fraud that have contributed to our nation\u2019s turmoil. By enforcing the law, reaffirming its supremacy, and restoring public trust, we can rebuild the foundation of justice. If we do not do it, then who will? This is the pressing question before us today.\nStabilizing the economy\nAs we took office, we were fully aware of the depth and scale of the economic challenges we were facing, even while we were engaged in opposition politics. Our economy was caught in a severe crisis, deeply entrenched in a massive recession and substantial economic contraction. We found ourselves dealing with an extremely fragile economic system. This economy cannot withstand drastic shocks, and so, immediately upon taking power, our focus turned to ensuring economic stability and reaffirming trust with the relevant economic stakeholders.\nWe understood that even the smallest error could have significant repercussions due to the scale of the crisis. Any disruption would only further harm the already delicate economic system. That\u2019s why we have approached every decision with utmost caution, taking into account every possible angle, to avoid any further damage. This economic crisis has left us with no room for mistakes. Therefore, when managing this economy, we must carefully consider every aspect, thoughtfully analyse all factors, engage in dialogue, and make well-informed decisions.\nTherefore, during the presidential and general elections, we promised the people that we would manage the economy in accordance with the parameters agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund. As a result, we are currently engaged in several crucial actions to stabilize the economy, and everyone knows that the third review by the IMF has been delayed.\nOriginally, this review was supposed to begin in September, but due to the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections, it was postponed. As soon as the General Election was concluded, the IMF delegation arrived on the 17th, and we have been in extended discussions with them. We are optimistic that by the 23rd, we will be able to finalize and will be able to sign an agreement with the IMF staff level, marking a critical step in our journey with the IMF.\nImplementing Agreements with the IMF to Stabilize the Economy\nThis is a crucial step in moving forward with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Additionally, the debt restructuring program agreed upon with the IMF has faced some challenges. When we assumed power, we had already reached an agreement on the restructuring of bilateral debt. We also had already started discussions on international sovereign bond debt in the commercial market. We recall that these discussions were publicly announced through the media, with the final agreement being made just two days before the Presidential Election.\nAs a result, we were not given an opportunity to revisit discussions on debt restructuring. The negotiations had already been on-going for more than two years. If we were to restart discussions on the restructuring program for an extended period, it would be impossible for us to move the economy forward without completing the debt restructuring process.\nWhen we assumed office, the discussions on debt restructuring, which had been on-going for nearly two years, were in their final stages. At this juncture, debating whether the proposed restructuring plan is good or bad, advantageous or disadvantageous, serves no purpose. This is the reality we are faced with. Based on this, we have reached a common understanding regarding bilateral debt. We are now prepared to quickly formalize agreements with individual countries accordingly.\nOn the other hand, with regard to international sovereign bonds and commercial market debt, we have reached a preliminary agreement. We anticipate that this process will be completed by the end of December. Consequently, we believe that the debt restructuring program with the International Monetary Fund can be successfully concluded before the end of this year. Additionally, we expect to secure staff-level agreement for the third review of the program this week, which will provide a credible foundation for rebuilding our economy.\nHowever, as a policy, we do not believe that this framework alone will suffice to address all the deep-seated crises facing our economy. Nevertheless, it will be adequate for managing the crisis in our financial sector. Yet, the economic structure of our nation is severely compromised, akin to a system suffering from significant structural collapse. Therefore, to navigate out of this breakdown, we must adopt a new economic strategy.\nThree New Economic Strategies\nThis new economic strategy is centred on three key pillars. First, we must achieve rapid growth and expansion in the production of goods and services in our country. It is essential to both increase and broaden the production of goods and services to revitalize our economy.\nOften, the significant economic growth of our country is driven by the Western Province. Therefore, the economy must be expanded to other provinces as well. The main strategy for our economy is rapid growth in the production of goods and services, along with quick expansion. The next key characteristic of this economy should be that it involves the people. We cannot benefit from an economy that excludes the people. An economy that turns people into mere spectators will not bring us any gains.\nIn every aspect of the economy, people should become active participants according to their abilities. If the people are not involved as key players in the economy, the benefits of that economy will not reach them. Therefore, our primary goal is to design an economy where people can be integrated as participants in the economic process. This becomes the second characteristic of our economic strategy.\nThe third characteristic of our economic strategy is that no matter how much national wealth we produce, if it becomes concentrated in the hands of a few, it will not bring stability to the state or the economy. Therefore, all citizens must come together to generate significant national wealth.\nThe country\u2019s natural resources are utilized to produce this wealth. If we all contribute to the creation of substantial national wealth but it becomes concentrated among a few, it will not stabilize the economy or society. Our policy, therefore, is that the benefits of the economy must be fairly distributed among the people. We have seen the history of large-scale crises created when wealth becomes concentrated among a few. Hence, we approach managing the economy from the standpoint that economic benefits must flow fairly to all citizens.\nEnsuring Consistent, High-Quality Goods and Services at Fair Prices Through Effective Market Management\nWe also have a policy regarding the interventions to the market. We understand that our country does not have a large market. Within this market, monopolies could be formed. For example, if we look at rice, our daily rice consumption is around 6,500 metric tons. Annually, we need approximately 2.3 million metric tons of rice.\nWhen compared with other countries around the world, our market shows the characteristics of a small market. The danger of a small market is that monopolies can be formed within it. Therefore, the market does not operate based on the data and trends in the economy. This is an experience we have encountered. Our market does not operate based on economic factors. Today, our country\u2019s market operates on monopolistic control. Monopolies are able to influence the pricing and decision-making of goods. They can determine the purchase prices of rice and other goods. These decisions are not made based on market factors but on the monopolistic power they hold in the market. As a result, the creation of monopolies in the market has led to the public bearing a heavy cost to purchase essential goods and services. Therefore, we hope to re-establish control over how our country\u2019s market operates.\nAs a government, our goal is to ensure that consumers have continuous access to goods and services at fair prices, while maintaining quality. This is a responsibility that the government has towards the public, and it is a responsibility we cannot neglect. To fulfil this responsibility, we are focusing on several mechanisms. One of these is the role of competition in the general economy, which can help create sustainability and quality while also determining prices. Therefore, in certain sectors, we expect to achieve these objectives through competition. However, there are also sectors where the market is not solely driven by free competition. In these areas, regulation through market authorities can ensure proper functioning. We have already established regulatory institutions for this purpose, and laws for regulatory authorities have been enacted in Parliament.\nHowever, we must reconsider whether these regulatory bodies and laws are sufficient to address the distortions currently present in the market.\nState Intervention in Market Regulation to Promote Competition\nThere are other sectors that are also crucial for the economy, particularly sensitive areas. In these sectors, market competition alone is not sufficient, and the state must play a role in controlling a segment of the market to ensure proper regulation. One such sector we are especially mindful of is the energy market. The free energy market should not be solely determined by free competition. When managing the energy market, the state must represent a portion of the market. This is a very sensitive area in the economy, as even a small fluctuation in the energy market can have a severe detrimental effect on the entire economy. Therefore, we firmly believe that in such sectors, the state must play an active role in regulating and representing the market.\nSimilarly, in the financial market, what would happen if it were allowed to operate freely without regulation? The Central Bank acts as the regulatory authority, but we believe that the state should also represent a segment of the financial market. Therefore, we consider certain critical areas in the market that should be managed by a state entity. We firmly believe that the state should operate as a regulatory arm in the market to ensure its stability and proper functioning.\nFourthly, instead of a fragmented market, we have the ability to organize and structure the market. We understand that in both our country and globally, the management of the market plays a crucial role, and cooperative networks contribute significantly to this. Therefore, we aim to strengthen these cooperative networks and position ourselves as a strong competitor in the market. Our strategy for managing production and the marketplace is straightforward and based on this foundation, and we are committed to implementing it. This is our core foundation.\nRapid Development of the Tourism and Information Technology Sectors\nBased on this, we have identified a few key areas where we can achieve short-term growth in the production of goods and services. One such area is the tourism industry, where we can quickly gain momentum. We have already developed plans to attract 4 million tourists and generate an $8 billion economy through the tourism sector within the next 3 to 4 years. The highest number of tourists we\u2019ve ever had was in 2018, with around 2.3 million visitors, bringing in approximately $4.3 billion to the economy. However, our goal is to attract 4 million tourists and generate an $8 billion economy through this sector. We believe that this is an area where we can achieve rapid growth.\nThe next key sector is Information Technology (IT). As we know, there is rapid growth in IT markets worldwide. Therefore, we need professionals with IT skills, literacy, and expertise. Currently, there are around 85,000 IT professionals in our country. Within the next five years, we aim to increase this number to 200,000. At present, our IT export income is around $1.2 billion, which is relatively small. We plan to increase IT exports to $5 billion, aiming for a significant transformation in the IT sector. To achieve this, we are focusing on education, particularly in languages, as a critical part of this strategy. We envision the IT sector as a major contributor to our country\u2019s economy, offering significant potential for growth.\nLeveraging Strategic Location to Transform Our Country into a Maritime Hub\nWe also know that our country\u2019s strategic location gives us a significant advantage in becoming a major trade and maritime hub. Even today, the Port of Colombo ranks highly among global ports. However, we have recognized the need for increased efficiency and faster management. Are the teams responsible for managing the port\u2019s operations satisfied with the current supply of goods and services? No, it has become inefficient.\nTherefore, we are in a unique position to leverage our location to transform our country into a powerful global trade and maritime centre. We must fully utilize this geographic advantage. We have already developed plans for this transformation, and we envision this as a place where we can rapidly unlock economic potential.\nBringing Revolutionary Change to the Agricultural Sector\nSimilarly, agriculture, we know that the environment here is ideal for it. There is a large farming community with access to fertile land. However, the outcome has been a farming community burdened with debt. A community that has been forced to mortgage even their jewellery to the bank. A community that has had to pledge its water pumps as collateral. We have made significant investments in agriculture. Over the past few decades, we\u2019ve heavily invested in irrigation. Today, I know we are continuing to invest in the development of the irrigation sector. We have also spent a great deal on agricultural research. But what has been the result? The farmer has become trapped in debt, turning them into a marginalized member of society. This has led to health insecurity.\nThe education of children has been ruined. They have been deprived of comfortable homes. The poverty of the farmer, who is caught in the struggles of agricultural life, has become a significant social tragedy. Therefore, we hope to make a new leap in agriculture. Specifically, we must revive our seed research laboratories. We must develop seed farms. We must reinstate a strong agricultural extension service. We must enter the market for agricultural products, not only meeting the needs of our country but also targeting the export market. We do not believe that the lives of the people can be improved through farming alone without innovation in the agricultural sector. We see it as a place where we can make rapid progress. That is why we increased the fertilizer subsidy given to the agricultural industry from Rs.15, 000 per hectare to Rs. 25,000 initially. If there are other areas that need subsidies, we are ready to provide them. Because agriculture must become a major part of our country\u2019s economy.\nWe are also focusing on the fishing industry. Our nation\u2019s sea is eight times the size of our land, yet we are only utilizing a small portion of this vast resource. The fishing industry holds great potential for boosting our economy. In the past, due to rising fuel costs and other expenses, many boats were stranded on land instead of being out at sea. This situation yielded no results. Therefore, our first priority was to get those boats back into the water. That\u2019s why we implemented a fuel subsidy for the fishing community. According to the latest reports, all the boats that were previously stranded have now been launched back into the sea. This is a positive sign, and it shows that the economy is on the path to a much-needed leap forward.\nTaking Steps to Maximize the Value of Mineral Resources with Support from the Private Sector\nAdditionally, in the long term, we believe that the natural resources in our country, particularly mineral resources, hold enormous potential for our economy.\nHowever, we have not been able to extract the value we need from these resources, nor have we added the necessary value for a long time. Therefore, we aim to establish a value-added industrial system by integrating both the state and private sector to transform these mineral resources into more value added products. We have already discussed this with local industrialists in our country. We do not believe this can be achieved solely by the state. For certain areas, we require technology, and for others, we need capital. Hence, we hope to engage private entrepreneurs to help develop this industrial system. We believe this will mark a new turning point for our economy.\nFurthermore, we believe that the area where our economy can undergo a significant transformation is science and technology. If we examine the developed countries around the world, each has invested a substantial portion of its annual budget in new research. The market does not progress by offering traditional and conservative goods and services. It evolves continuously, leaving behind old products and services, creating new markets for innovative products and services. Recently, several countries in the Asian region have successfully captured these new markets. However, we have failed to participate in the new global market. Instead, we have remained a participant in the market that offers traditional and conservative goods and services.\nOur goal is to make a significant leap in the field of scientific research. This is why we have established a dedicated Ministry of Science and Technology and appointed former Professor Chrishantha from the Ragama Medical Faculty, who has vast experience in the field, as its Minister. We have also appointed individuals like Gomika, who has conducted major research in the United States and brought international recognition to Sri Lanka, as the Advisor to the President on Science and Technology. We expect this transformation in science and technology to bring about a major impact.\nThe next key area is digitalization, and building a digital economy. We believe that we can grow from a digital economy into a USD 15 billion economy. To support this, we have created a separate Ministry of Digitalization. In particular, we are fortunate to have Hans Wijayasuriya, who has deep knowledge and experience in this field. He has resigned from a prominent international company to dedicate himself to digitizing Sri Lanka.\nI am ready to appoint him as the Secretary of that Ministry, Chairman of the ICT Institute, and Advisor to the President on Digitalization. It is essential that this initiative is managed from a single, unified place. We are committed to achieving this goal.\nDigitalization is crucial, especially for providing services to citizens and advancing the economy to a new level. To elevate our country from its current state to a new level, the hallmark of that future will be a Digital Sri Lanka. Our government is fully dedicated to achieving this vision. We are doing everything in our power to ensure its success, and we are confident it will be realized successfully.\n\u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d Project\nNext, we will launch a major initiative called \u201cCleaning Sri Lanka.\u201d I plan to establish a presidential task force to lead this effort. It\u2019s important to note that Clean Sri Lanka is not just about the environment. While our people can bring about positive changes in political leadership and the civil service, we also need a transformation in the mind-set of citizens to build a strong nation. Without this positive shift in citizenship, we will not succeed in achieving the broader goals of political transformation. Therefore, we must make a concerted effort to foster good citizenship, positive attitudes, responsible actions, and proper behaviour. This is the core objective of the Cleaning Sri Lanka program.\nIn particular, though it may not be a topic for national assembly discussions, even issues at the provincial council level need attention. For example, we should ask the women of our country: Do they have access to clean toilet facilities? I am aware that some women who travel to Colombo from remote areas often avoid drinking water until they return home.\nWhy? She does not have access to a clean sanitation system. Even where toilet facilities exist, maintaining them in a clean and hygienic manner has become unmanageable. Despite having a physical infrastructure, where is the development in societal attitudes? What was meant to be a shared public space has been reduced to a site of neglect and destruction. What does this reflect? It is a manifestation of the mind-set and attitudes prevalent within a certain segment of our citizens. Through the Clean Sri Lanka Program, we aim to initiate such a transformative change in these perceptions.\nHow do we safeguard public property? How do we become citizens who are accountable to society? How do we preserve our nation\u2019s resources, not only for those of us living today but also for future generations? How do we drive responsibly as motorists? How do we cross the road safely? How do we respect one another? How do we follow basic courtesies when entering a space?\nDon\u2019t we aspire to create such a society? Right now, we exist in a community burdened by tragedy, a fractured society filled with conflicts and discontent. A society where even minor incidents frequently escalate into confrontations, rather than being resolved with patience, forgiveness, or compassion. There is no space for tolerance, understanding, or empathy. What we are witnessing is a society hardened and parched, deprived of humanity\u2019s fundamental virtues.\nThis society needs revival. A parched, joyless, and rigid society cannot progress. We need a community that smiles, a society where people look at one another with kindness and compassion. We need a humane, empathetic society, one that is sensitive to the pain of others and ready to provide solace.\nIn particular, we aspire to bring about significant transformation in the fields of education, literature, law, and societal values. This includes fostering an advanced and qualitative society.\nWith this goal in mind, the National People\u2019s Power government is committed to creating an environment that nurtures these values, enabling a progressive and compassionate community.\nProviding the Necessary Economic Support to Eradicate Poverty\nPoverty needs to be eradicated. Doesn\u2019t every citizen deserve a fair meal, quality education for their children, a decent home, stable income opportunities, and mental well-being? Addressing rural and urban poverty has become one of the government\u2019s primary missions. As an initial step toward eradicating poverty, we are committed to increasing the existing welfare allowances fairly in the upcoming budget. Additionally, provisions will be made to support schoolchildren from economically disadvantaged families with allowances for essential school supplies. From October, we are increasing pensions for retirees, and in the forthcoming budget, we will ensure a fair increase in wages for public sector employees.\nEnsuring that Every Citizen is Taken Care of\nChild malnutrition will not be allowed to escalate into a future social crisis. To combat malnutrition, we plan to provide targeted allowances to affected families and ensure that pregnant mothers receive the necessary nutritious meals to safeguard their health and well-being. Furthermore, we will facilitate access to goods and services currently out of reach for many due to poverty.\nHowever, long-term reliance on such measures is not sustainable for any government. Every country at any given time has economically productive and non-productive populations. Even in what are considered the most developed nations, there exists a population outside active economic participation. Therefore, it remains the government\u2019s enduring responsibility to support these groups, and we will not neglect this duty.\nIn particular, our nation has a significant population of differently-abled individuals. You are aware that in households with a differently-abled child, the entire family often faces considerable hardship. These children are frequently deprived of opportunities to lead culturally enriching lives, and their conditions often consume the lives of their parents and siblings. This should not be the inevitable fate of families with differently-abled members. Therefore, we are introducing special mechanisms and allowances to support differently-abled individuals.\nOur government must be one that looks after all its citizens, a government that leaves no one behind. This responsibility and commitment are inherent to every administration. We will fulfil that commitment and are prepared to act in accordance with this responsibility.\nWe do not believe that poverty can be eradicated solely through the continued provision of relief and allowances. To eliminate poverty, individuals must engage in economically productive activities that yield tangible outcomes. Currently, the primary economic activity of many living in poverty is agriculture. Unless agriculture is transformed into a profitable enterprise, it will be impossible to lift these individuals out of poverty.\nSimilarly, without making the fishing industry a lucrative one, we cannot address the poverty faced by fishing communities. Therefore, our first priority is to develop the economic activities in which these individuals are already engaged, turning them into successful and profitable ventures.\nHowever, we recognize that these activities alone are insufficient for a village\u2019s economic advancement. New economic opportunities and resources must be introduced within rural areas.\nWe also see an alarming trend of small and medium entrepreneurs seeking opportunities abroad. Instead of this exodus, we must foster a mind-set of staying and thriving as small and medium-scale entrepreneurs within the country. Providing the necessary technical knowledge, capital, and access to markets is a responsibility the government takes seriously. However, we acknowledge that our local market is limited, with only around 3.8 million participants in our dual economies, making it a relatively small market. It is not feasible for industries, entrepreneurs, and businesses to develop into a robust economic community solely within this small domestic market. Thus, these industrialists and entrepreneurs must look outward, exploring new markets beyond our borders.\nComprehensive Reform of Diplomatic Services\nIn this context, we intend to overhaul our diplomatic services entirely. While maintaining our commitment to fostering international relations, we are also committed to going beyond traditional diplomacy to assist Sri Lankan industries in finding and accessing global markets. To achieve this, we are realigning the operations of our diplomatic missions.\nAdditionally, we recognize the immense technical expertise and resources available in the construction industry within our country. We must strategize to take this industry beyond Sri Lanka\u2019s borders. Furthermore, Sri Lanka possesses unique and indigenous products that hold significant potential. By adding more value to these products and building a modern industrial framework, we aim to take them to international markets. This is a critical step in enhancing their worth and ensuring the sustainable economic growth of the nation.\nTherefore, small and medium-scale entrepreneurs must not merely act based on their own preferences and decisions. The growth of the small and medium enterprise sector must also align with the vision of the state and the government, and we must take responsibility for fostering this development. To this end, we have formulated clear plans.\nNew Budget to Be Approved by Mid-March\nOur vision is encapsulated within the framework of \u201cA Thriving Nation\u2013 A Beautiful Life,\u201d where the detailed strategies and initiatives are outlined. Our ministers are already studying the\nresponsibilities assigned to their respective ministries within this framework. While we may not be in a position to present a complete budget immediately, we plan to submit an interim budget by early December to allocate the necessary financial provisions for the next four months. By early February, we aim to present a comprehensive budget proposal and expect it to be approved in Parliament by mid-March.\nThus, the practical implementation of this plan is embedded within the upcoming budget. Although the ideas have currently been shared in conceptual terms, the budget will be structured based on these concepts and we anticipate having it passed in Parliament by mid-March.\nSeeking the Support of All to Achieve a Successful New Era\nOur nation is at the beginning of a new era of transformation in its economy and society. I am hopeful that all members of this Parliament will support making this new era of transformation a success. While we may belong to diverse political camps, hold opposing ideologies, and even engage in fierce debates and criticism, today, we are united by a common goal. As representatives of the people, we share the profound responsibility of creating a better country. My government and I am fully committed to this responsibility, and I trust that the leaders and members of all opposition parties will extend their support to this endeavour.\nIn conclusion, I am reminded of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s words:\n\u201cDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\u201d\nThank you very much."

      "\u2013 President Stated Following the Swearing-in of the New Cabinet",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that the immense power granted to the ministers must be wielded with responsibility. He acknowledged that while the victory is monumental, the weight of the responsibility that comes with it is equally important, and that collective effort is needed to carry it forward.\nThese remarks were made by President Dissanayake during the ceremony held this morning (18) at the Presidential Secretariat, where the new Cabinet Ministers of the National People\u2019s Power Government were sworn in.",
      "In his address, President Dissanayake further elaborated on the critical importance of responsibility in leadership.\n\u201cA decisive turning point in Sri Lankan politics occurred on September 21, marking a momentous shift in the country\u2019s trajectory. On this day, the people made a bold choice to change the long-traveled path of our nation. Their decision was further reinforced by the parliamentary elections that followed, where the general public placed their trust in us with renewed confidence.",
      "This transformative journey saw the enthusiastic participation of citizens across the nation. Historically, Sri Lanka\u2019s political landscape has often been defined by a divide; North against South, and vice versa, which was fueled by mistrust and division. However, this election has shattered those boundaries, demonstrating that the politics of division no longer holds sway. For the first time, the aspirations of the people in the North, South, East, and West have converged on a shared vision for our future.",
      "We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who contributed to the strong mandate given to the National People\u2019s Power. Even those who voted for other political movements are part of this shared journey, as the goals we pursue are aligned with the aspirations of all Sri Lankans. We firmly believe that no citizen supports the politics of corruption, nor does any politician seek to erode democracy. These values of integrity, fairness, and democracy, are deeply ingrained in our society. Through their votes, the people have reaffirmed their commitment to these principles, and we trust that those who did not vote share these same ideals.\nIn this context, there are no winners or losers in this election. There are no divisions between those celebrating the results and those disappointed by them. Instead, we all share a collective responsibility to achieve the goals that will uplift our nation. We need the trust and support of every citizen to realize these objectives.\nEven after our victory in the presidential election, we have consistently demonstrated our commitment to peacefully upholding democracy and respecting the political rights of all. This commitment remains at the heart of our efforts to build a united and prosperous Sri Lanka.\nI believe this is a new experience for the people of this country. However, we trust that this experience is one every citizen of our nation has long hoped for. Furthermore, during and after the general election, our administration provided the opportunity for one of the most peaceful elections in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. This was their right.\nThis election is truly historic, marked by several unique characteristics. Quantitatively, it represents the most significant victory ever achieved in a general election in Sri Lanka. Politically, it is the first time in electoral history that a political movement has secured governance through such a victory. On the other hand, it is a victory that the people of this country can genuinely celebrate. Such a triumph has been possible for us and our citizens because these changes are essential for our nation.\nWe have often seen in our country\u2019s history that whenever a victory is achieved, it tends to lead to resentment or suffering for the defeated or the opposing side. However, this election has allowed us to create a new political culture for our country. This culture ensures that, even after the general election, we have maintained stability and safeguarded the continuity of this progressive political approach.\nEvents may occur. At one moment, there may be peaceful democracy; at another, there may be instances of conflict. However, these situations only become recurring if we allow them to stabilize through repeated occurrences. That is why the windows we open for democracy and our commitment to protecting the democratic rights of citizens should not be reduced to mere isolated events or limited to a handful of occasions. If we continuously safeguard and uphold these principles, they will transcend mere occurrences and become enduring practices.\nTherefore, it is our responsibility to consistently protect and elevate the rights of citizens within this democratic framework, ensuring they reach higher qualitative standards. I believe this is a critical responsibility of the government.",
      "Notably, during this election campaign, Sri Lankans living abroad provided us with remarkable support, enthusiasm, and courage. In the history of our elections, there has rarely been such a level of interest demonstrated by the diaspora. I believe their involvement and contributions in this election surpassed all previous instances, reflecting their active participation and engagement.\nEven though they are outside Sri Lanka, we know they celebrated the results of this election with great joy and enthusiasm. We are profoundly grateful to them for their unwavering support.\nWe understand that, generally, the significance of politics during an election lies in bringing our ideas and perspectives to society. In doing so, our political movement played its part, but there was also a new generation that voluntarily took on this responsibility through social media. It is essential that we recognize the unique aspirations of this younger generation. What they showcased on social media was not merely a competition, a race, or a contest to distinguish winners from losers. Instead, it reflected their hopes and goals. Therefore, we must remain committed to these aspirations, as I believe they are vital. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to everyone who contributed in various ways to achieving this victory.\nHowever, there is something we must understand. The secret behind this public uprising, filled with immense hope, lies in the long-standing struggles faced by our citizens. For years, people have endured various forms of oppression. Instances where citizens felt helpless and victimized before the law were all too common. Economically, there exists a marginalized group of people who have been ignored, reduced to mere \u201cdust\u201d within the system. These are individuals who lack access to proper meals, decent housing, and opportunities for a healthy, fulfilling life, burdened by economic hardships.\nMoreover, professionals have faced frustrations within their fields, unable to freely apply their knowledge and skills. This has created deep-seated grievances for those struggling to perform their duties effectively. Similarly, there are communities who, based on the language they speak, the religion they follow, or their cultural identity, have experienced discrimination and alienation.\nThese individuals have often felt isolated within Sri Lanka, considering themselves sidelined or excluded rather than being equally represented and entitled to their rights.\nThis sense of marginalization and oppression has been pervasive, shaping the deep challenges faced by many in our country.\nAcross every sector, people in this country have faced unique and deeply personal struggles. I know that even government officials, tasked with upholding the law, have been victims of this oppression. That is the reality. Therefore, the results of this election symbolize an invitation to freedom for those who have suffered. They longed for this freedom, driven by the need to escape the various forms of oppression they endured. These election results are an affirmation of their demand for that freedom.",
      "We have no right to limit or restrict this freedom for our citizens. Instead, we must ensure full freedom across all sectors. This includes granting professionals the liberty to carry out their responsibilities with their knowledge and expertise, enabling law enforcement officials to fulfill their duties in upholding law and peace, ensuring fair economic participation for all, and reaffirming every citizen\u2019s right to live freely according to their religion, language, and cultural identity. It is for these reasons that we say Sri Lanka must move toward a period of renewal.\nWe must create a more liberated environment for the people of this country. We recognize that this victory was achieved through the immense involvement of ordinary people. Many who had no direct connection to our political mechanism, whom we had never met or spoken with, worked tirelessly on our behalf. Whether on buses, trains, workplaces, or during community events, countless individuals advocated for our victory.\nIt is also important to remember that this victory was the result of a long struggle, spanning decades. Many among us have been committed to this dream since their youth. In this struggle, people sacrificed not only their time and effort but, in some cases, their very lives. During the early and most challenging phases, we worked relentlessly to protect this movement. While some left midway, even those who departed provided critical support at various stages at the beginning, in the middle, and wherever needed. Their contributions, too, have been instrumental in achieving this victory.\nTherefore, we have two distinct responsibilities. The first is our obligation to fulfill the goals and aspirations of the people. The second is our duty toward the movement itself. We firmly believe that power is something very significant. Power generates more power, expands its influence, and continues to grow. However, history has shown, and some argue, that power is corrupt where unlimited power leads to unlimited corruption. This is true. Power can corrupt, and absolute power can corrupt absolutely, as has been proven repeatedly.\nIn our country, there have been instances where such concentrated power was created. But if we examine the outcomes of those powers, they rarely brought justice or fairness to the people.\nInstead, they were often wielded in ways that harmed the nation and its citizens. Some might believe that unlimited power has been granted, leading to concerns about where this unrestricted power might lead.\nTo anyone harbouring even a small doubt, I want to say this: Yes, it is true that we hold power. However, we also recognize the boundaries and limitations of this power. We understand the framework within which this power has been entrusted to us. It is important for all of us to acknowledge that power exists, but it comes with constraints and a purpose.\nThe purpose of this power lies in fulfilling the positive goals and expectations that we have promised to the people over a long period. It is a responsibility entrusted to us to use this power for the greater good and to achieve the aspirations of our citizens.",
      "The key point is that this power comes with responsibilities, on one side, a responsibility to the citizens, and on the other, a responsibility to the movement. I believe that no matter what form of power is created for us through constitutions, regulations, or other mechanisms, we must exercise it with accountability. We are accountable to the people and to the movement. This is why power cannot exist in isolation or function arbitrarily. It must be bound by responsibility and commitment.\nI believe that compared to an ordinary citizen, a Member of Parliament, and even more so, a Cabinet Minister, has a greater responsibility. This is something you all must understand; I don\u2019t need to explain it anew. You are aware of the boundaries and limitations of your power. You know your responsibilities and commitments, and I trust that you will safeguard them.\nAdditionally, there\u2019s another discussion to be had. Many of you are new to the Cabinet, and some are even new to Parliament. However, for a long time, we have all worked toward various goals on different platforms. Some of you have worked as professionals, others as political activists. While you may be new to these positions, you are not new to politics or to working for change.\nThis gives me confidence that this Cabinet can bring new and inspiring examples to the people and deliver the victories that the country expects. If we execute our responsibilities effectively, I am confident you have the ability, the commitment, and the integrity to fulfill these tasks. I personally know that you are unblemished, honest, and courageous, and I firmly believe you will approach your responsibilities with sincerity. It is with this confidence that we move forward.\nIn politics, there was a time when we worked solely to build the movement and rally people around political goals. Our slogans, campaigns, and actions were all geared toward winning power. We fought tirelessly to make our case to the citizens of this country, and the results of that effort are now evident. We have achieved political victory.\nHowever, moving forward, our work will not rely solely on political slogans. Before September 21 and November 14, our focus was on our principles and political ideologies. But from November 14 onward, the measure of our success will be the quality of governance we deliver. Previously, we were judged on the effectiveness of our political activism; now, we will be evaluated on whether our governance is good or bad. This is the new standard by which we will be measured.\nTherefore, in order to achieve the goals that the people expect, and to address the long-standing efforts we have made, good governance is essential. This is necessary to guide us towards our targets. We are not driven by slogans or ideologies; from today onwards, we are measured by how effectively we manage our efforts to achieve our goals.\nThe magnitude of our success is significant, and along with it comes the weight of the responsibility entrusted to us. At times, we have said that we will fight for victory, and after that, the relevant capable teams will take the next steps. However, whether for good or bad, we have had to fight for victory. After the victory, we have become the leaders responsible for ensuring the success of that mission.",
      "Thus, all of this lies with you. You are the centre. How capable are you of guiding your field to achieve productive results and fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to you? How successful are you in meeting your personal commitments and duties? Our next success or failure will be determined by this.\nOn September 21 and November 14, we made progress in two stages. As we decide whether we will succeed or not in the next phase, your role is crucial. We can only conclude this successfully if you remain committed to good governance. For this, let us work together. Let us raise our voices together.\u201d"

      "The agreement was signed today (07) by K.M. Mahinda Siriwardana, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development, Policy Formulation, Planning, and Tourism, and David N. Sislen, World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka in the presence of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.",
      "This financing is part of the World Bank\u2019s continued commitment to assist Sri Lanka in its comprehensive reform agenda. The RESET DPF program, which operates in tandem with the IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (EFF), is aimed at addressing the root causes of the island nation\u2019s ongoing economic crisis. The two-year program (2023\u20132024) is designed to restore stability through macroeconomic adjustments while protecting the poor and vulnerable. The first phase of the program, implemented in 2023, successfully secured USD 500 million after meeting seven key prior actions under three pillars.",
      "The three key pillars of the RESET DPF program are:",
      "1. Improving Economic Governance: Strengthening fiscal discipline, transparency, and accountability in public resource management while safeguarding financial stability.",
      "2. Enhancing Growth and Competitiveness: Unlocking Sri Lanka\u2019s growth potential through a more competitive private sector.",
      "3. Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable: Shielding the most affected segments of society from the economic fallout of the crisis.",
      "In 2024, the Government of Sri Lanka plans to access the USD 200 million loan from the IDA to support the second phase of the RESET program. To qualify, the government must fulfill nine prior actions under the three key pillars and maintain a sound macroeconomic policy framework. The World Bank Board granted approval for the financing facility, which will take effect upon the signing of the Financing Agreement.",
      "This financial assistance from the World Bank is expected to play a crucial role in stabilizing Sri Lanka\u2019s economy and preventing a recurrence of similar crises in the future, while fostering a more inclusive and competitive economic environment."

      "We are launching a permanent program to build a unified Sri Lankan nation that respects diversity, fully ending the era of division based on race, religion, class, and caste.\nWe have already taken significant steps to appoint efficient and honest officials to oversee these initiatives. We are advancing steadily toward the desired changes, ensuring that public service remains intact and citizens are not adversely affected.",
      "We are committed to creating a law-abiding nation and fostering a disciplined society while ensuring the social security of all citizens. This revives the principle that everyone is equal before the law.",
      "We believe that public service plays a crucial role in nation-building. To that end, we will establish a public service that instills pride in the community and aligns with the government\u2019s goals. Our commitment is to create an efficient, honest, and people-focused public service.",
      "Our goal is to improve the standard of living for the people of this country. We are implementing practical programs to alleviate the heavy burdens faced by our citizens.\nNo parent in this country should have to worry about their child\u2019s future. Every parent deserves the right to provide their child with access to quality schools and education. We are fully committed to securing the future of the next generation by ensuring excellent education for all children. By fostering knowledge, attitudes, and skills, we are building a promising future for the young generation of our country.",
      "When we visit a country, the airport often offers a first impression, reflecting its order, the behaviour of its people, their work ethic, and cultural practices.",
      "It also reveals the country\u2019s cleanliness, how vehicles are driven, how the elderly are treated, the hospitality shown, and even how animals are cared for. We have developed clear plans to enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s image in these areas, with short-term, medium-term, and long-term initiatives already underway.",
      "Our goal is to create a nation where the world respects our passport, and where every citizen can proudly say, \u201cI am a Sri Lankan.\u201d We aim to build a country where citizenship is a source of pride for all. Achieving this vision will require the collective effort of every citizen.",

We are actively working to enhance women\u2019s representation across all institutions. As a testament to our commitment, we have already appointed a woman as Prime Minister.",

I welcome your constructive criticism and encourage you to join us in building the future together. If we can set aside our differences, I believe you will see that we share the same goals. Together, we can confront the challenges facing our country and develop the necessary strategies to move forward. Our doors are open to all who are genuinely and positively committed to the progress of our nation.",
      "We require a Parliament that accurately reflects the will of the people. The existing Parliament does not represent that will. Therefore, I took the step yesterday to dissolve it. A cabinet was appointed in line with our parliamentary representation to guide the country in accordance with the constitution.\nThere is one dream our people see every new day the sun rises.\nThat is \u201ctomorrow will be better than today!\u201d\nHowever,\nYou and I both learn for many years, this has remained merely a dream.\nOpportunism, the greed of power, and authoritarianism has hindered our country\u2019s progress.\nBut now we have our final opportunity which cannot be missed. Let us unite to create a thriving and beautiful country that embraces diversity."
