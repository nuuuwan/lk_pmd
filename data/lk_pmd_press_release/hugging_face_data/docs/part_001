      "The Vadduvakal Bridge, located near the Nandikadal Lagoon along the Paranthan \u2013 Karachchi \u2013 Mullaitivu road, accommodates more than 3,000 vehicles daily. Due to the lack of maintenance over an extended period, the bridge has become severely unsafe. The Road Development Authority has planned to construct a new two-lane bridge at a cost of Rs. 1.4 billion in public funds, with completion targeted for September 2, 2027.",
      "Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Bimal Rathnayake, speaking at the event, highlighted that although the project was initially estimated at Rs. 1.8 billion, under the current government\u2019s transparent administration it will be completed at a reduced cost of Rs. 1.4 billion. The remaining Rs. 400 million will be allocated for highway development in the Vanni District. He further stated that Rs. 12.5 billion has been allocated for the construction of bridges and highways in the North this year, with provisions expected to increase further in the coming year.",
      "Minister Rathnayake also emphasized that the present government is dedicated to rebuilding the entire country while uniting the North through peace and development. He urged the public to evaluate the current administration based on observable efforts and concrete actions rather than prejudiced ideas.",
      "Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources, Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Deputy Minister of Cooperative Development Upali Samarasingha, Governor of the Northern Province Nagalingam Vethanayahan, Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Senior Professor Kapila C.K.

      "\u201cWe are fulfilling the responsibility of revitalising the North and building a stronger economy for its people\u201d \u2013 President",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasised that the government is committed to revitalising the Northern Province and building a stronger economy for its people.",
      "President Dissanayake noted that during the last Presidential Election, the people of the North placed their trust in the present government and took a step forward and assured that this government would carry that victory into the future. The President further stated that a series of development programmes, including the establishment of industrial zones, will soon be implemented to create new economic opportunities in the North.",
      "He also stressed that the government is dedicated to safeguarding the land rights, linguistic rights and cultural rights of the people in the North, while ensuring their right to know about the missing persons. The President affirmed that the government\u2019s goal is to build national unity within the country and that the necessary decisions and measures will be taken without hesitation to achieve this.",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made these remarks today (2) while attending the inauguration ceremony of the Northern Coconut Triangle in Puthukkudiyiruppu, coinciding with the World Coconut Day celebrations held under the theme \u201cRatama Saru Karai Nirathuru \u2013 Kapthuru Saviya.\u201d",
      "Based on recommendations from the Coconut Research Institute, the Northern Coconut Triangle has been established, covering the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya, by linking the towns of Point Pedro, Silawathura and Kokkilai. Under this initiative, Rs. 500 million was allocated from the previous budget to provide high-yield coconut saplings to cultivators in the North and to develop 16,000 acres of new coconut plantations in 2025.\nOver the three years from 2025 to 2027, the cultivated extent is expected to increase to 40,000 acres. This is aimed at establishing a thriving coconut industry in the Northern Province, uplifting the livelihoods of its people and raising export earnings from coconut-related products by an additional USD 70 million annually.",
      "On this occasion, the President also presented ownership deeds for government assistance to farmers engaged in coconut cultivation across the five districts of the Northern Province.\nThe commemorative magazine prepared for the 2025 World Coconut Day celebrations was officially presented to the President.",
      "Furthermore, Deputy Director General of the International Coconut Community, Mr Nuwan Chinthaka, presented to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake the certificate of recognition awarded to Sri Lanka by the International Coconut Community.",
      "Addressing the ceremony, President Dissanayake said;",
      "We know that the Puthukkudiyiruppu area has in the past been one of the regions most severely affected by conflict. As a result of those battles, the people here lost everything. During the last election, I had the opportunity to meet with the people of this region. It is clear that both the area and its people need to be rejuvenated. In particular, during the last election, the people living in these areas placed their trust in us and took a significant step forward. It is our expectation to carry that trust forward towards success.",
      "To achieve this, we have already begun work in several areas. Firstly, we must ensure the rights of these people. We recognise land rights, language rights, cultural rights and the right to know about their missing loved ones, as their fundamental rights. We have therefore launched a series of measures to safeguard these rights.",
      "Secondly, we must strengthen their economy. As a government, we take responsibility for restoring the economic opportunities they lost and creating a robust economy for them. For this too, we have already taken a number of steps.",
      "Among them are the establishments of new industrial zones in the North, the development of tourism as a sector with fresh potential, the provision of essential facilities such as water for agriculture and as a central initiative, the coconut cultivation project launched today.\nUnder this programme, the Ministry has planned to cultivate 16,000 acres of coconut this year, involving nearly 12,000 farming families. We believe this project will become a strong foundation for uplifting the economy of these people.",
      "Equally important is the unity we must build among ourselves at a cultural level. To this end, we have named a day that can be celebrated by all together. We are also working to strengthen interrelations through sport. We are engaged in a significant effort to reunite people who have long been divided.",
      "For decades, the lives of those here were overshadowed by war. Distrust, suspicion and weapons defined a 30-year-long conflict. That was a great tragedy for our country. It divided our people and gave rise to communal politics.",
      "Both in the North and the South, communalism became the main tool for gaining power. Yet, during the last Presidential Election, the people of this country defeated that trend. We will not allow communal politics to resurface in this country again. Likewise, I believe that you, too, as citizens, must reject such politics.",
      "Our government\u2019s goal is to create unity. We will not hesitate to take any decision necessary to achieve this, even if it may seem difficult. Nor will we allow the regressive, destructive slogans of the past to obstruct the progressive measures we are now taking.",
      "The people of these areas continue to suffer from severe economic hardships. Step by step, we are working to provide solutions to these challenges. Over the past year, we have laid the foundation for this essential work. Today, the political authority has been cleansed of corruption and fraud. We are working to strengthen the public service, to re-establish the rule of law and to increase state revenue. Our aim is to build a strong economy that will enable us to repay our debts.",
      "We are also restarting stalled development projects, as well as launching many new ones. In every sector, we have initiated fresh development. In this way, we have laid the foundation for transforming this country into a new state. Upon this foundation, we will rebuild Sri Lanka, making it once more a nation respected and admired by the world. On this journey, we seek the support of all of you. Let us join together, without division of any kind, in this path of national transformation.",
      "The Maha Sangha and members of the clergy, Minister of Plantation and Community Infrastructure, Samantha Vidyaratne, Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Bimal Ratnayake, Deputy Minister of Cooperative Development Upali Samarasingha, Deputy Minister of Land and Irrigation Susil Ranasinghe, Governor of the Northern Province Nagalingam Vethanayahan, Secretary to the Ministry of Plantation and Community Infrastructure Prabath Chandrakeerthi, the District Secretaries of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, other state officials, foreign delegates, as well as representatives of the Coconut Research Institute, Coconut Development Authority, Coconut Cultivation Board, the Chilaw Plantations Company, the Kurunegala Plantations Company and several other public and private institutions also attended this occasion."

      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that efforts are underway to enable the public to carry out all payments and transactions with the government through online methods by next year.",
      "The President stated that digitalisation, a key programme of the present government, enables the decentralisation of all administrative functions, which were previously confined to Colombo, to remote rural villages, thereby giving the people the opportunity to access government services much more conveniently.",
      "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated this while participating in the event to open the Jaffna Regional Office of the Department of Immigration and Emigration today (01).",
      "This office, established within the premises of the Jaffna District Secretariat, is equipped with all facilities including modern technology.",
      "Until now, the people of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu had to travel a long distance to the Vavuniya Regional Office, the only regional office in the Northern Province, to obtain immigration and emigration services. As the number of foreign passport applications from the Northern Province is increasing, this regional office was opened to fulfill the need for a more easily accessible location.",
      "The issuance of three passports by the President symbolised the commencement of providing Department of Immigration and Emigration services to the people of Jaffna.",
      "Subsequently, at a meeting with Jaffna District public officials held at the auditorium of the Jaffna District Secretariat, the President stated that in order to meet the expectations of the people, political authorities and public officials must work together.",
      "The President emphasised that while the government will do its utmost to protect public officials who use their authority for the welfare of the people, it will not hesitate to enforce the law against those who misuse that authority for monetary gain. He further stated that, at present, all public servants in the country have the opportunity to fulfill their duty to the nation.",
      "The President further pointed out that a strong public service is needed to build the country and behind the development of every developed country in the world, there is a strong public service.\nFurther expressing his views, President Anura Kumara Dissanayak said;",
      "\u201cToday, we have established facilities for obtaining services from the Regional Office of the Department of Immigration and Emigration at the Jaffna District Secretariat. Although symbolically it was the issuance of an immigration document, our intervention in this task had a much broader purpose. Our entire administrative structure has been centred in Colombo, compelling people living in distant provinces to travel to Colombo for many services.",
      "The aim of our government is to decentralise this administration to even the most remote rural villages. Facilities must be arranged so that citizens can access government services close to them. By next year, our objective is to enable people to carry out all their transactions with the government through computer software systems and even from their mobile phones. The foremost priority of our government is digitalisation.",
      "At the same time, steps have been taken to strengthen the public service. At the District Committee meeting held at this very place earlier, I announced that we would be granting a salary increase in April. We have done so. By next January, we will ensure that the remaining portion of that increase is also provided. If this country is to be rebuilt, a strong public service is essential. Every developed nation has a robust public service and we too are working to build one in our country.\u201d",
      "Your signature carries great responsibility. If you use it to serve the people, we will give you our fullest protection. But if you use it for financial gain, the law will take its course. We need a State that upholds the rule of law. Unfortunately, our country has become a place where the law has been disregarded and the dignity of public institutions has collapsed. We must restore respect to every state institution and ensure that every public officer regains the honour they deserve. To support this, we will provide the necessary facilities to state institutions.",
      "Our country has reached a point where we must rebuild from the ground up. We have a comprehensive development plan for the Northern Province. For the first time, at the last Presidential and General Elections, the people of the North entrusted their votes to form a government. In a country once divided and mistrustful, people placed confidence in governance. Our duty now is to ensure that this unity is not broken but strengthened, building a nation of togetherness and brotherhood for future generations.",
      "We are aware that certain defeated political forces are attempting to use nationalism as a tool to regain power. This can be seen both in the North and the South. But such nationalist politics serve politicians, not the people. Therefore, all of us whether in the North or the South must reject nationalist politics and ensure it never rises again. We are firmly committed to this.",
      "As a government, we strongly believe there will never be another war in our country. Some try to spread fear that war will return. But our work is to ensure it does not. We must return people\u2019s lands to them, reopen closed roads and eliminate suspicion between communities. I am confident that all of us will work to prevent another war and with that mind-set, we must move our country forward. We must build a new society, leaving behind failed political movements, religious divisions and casteism these belong to the past. Today, what matters is not ethnicity, religion or caste, but humanity. We must place humanity above all divisions and build a country where humanity is the highest value. That is the future of both our country and the world.",
      "I am aware that when we excavate the earth, old skeletons surface. Today, the discovery of mass graves in Chemmani has caused great concern. We are conducting a fully transparent investigation into these. Our goal is to ensure that such mass graves will never be created again in this country.",
      "At this moment, we are fulfilling the most important needs of our nation. Together with our religious leaders, political authorities, state officials and representatives of the security forces, we must work with one purpose. As political leaders, we will fulfill our responsibilities to the fullest. Let us all unite to rebuild this country.",

    "article_body_paragraphs": [
      "The government has decided to launch a special programme called \u2018Seiri Week\u2019under the national initiative Clean Sri Lanka. It will run from September 1 to 4, targeting all state institutions, with the aim of improving efficiency and productivity in the public service.",
      "The main goal of this programme is to create a peaceful, safe and well-organized working environment for public officials. The concept of Seiri, part of the five principles of productivity, refers to identifying what is necessary and eliminating what is unnecessary.",
      "Accordingly, a key focus will be on removing unused items from state institutions and making the best use of limited space.",
      "According to a circular issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government, all Ministries, Departments and state organizations must allocate two hours each morning during this week for cleaning and organizing. Attention will also be given to maintaining clean and attractive buildings and surroundings, improving access roads and ensuring facilities for persons with disabilities.",
      "Guidelines have also been given to properly dispose of unusable inventory items, old motor vehicles and out-dated files.",
      "Crucially, Seiri Week is intended to be an on-going initiative rather than a singular occurrence. All the Heads of the institutions have been directed to implement a lasting framework to maintain the organized environment fostered during this programme, with designated officials tasked with ensuring its persistence."
