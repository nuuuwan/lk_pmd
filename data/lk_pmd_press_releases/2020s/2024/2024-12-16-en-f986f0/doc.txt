The discussions also focused on strengthening Sri Lanka’s ties with India by establishing electricity grid connections and a multi-product petroleum pipeline. These initiatives aim to provide technical support to Sri Lanka in the areas of physical, digital, and energy infrastructure, marking a new chapter in bilateral relations with a forward-looking vision.

Additionally, India will collaborate on improving housing, renewable energy, and infrastructure in Sri Lanka, alongside enhancing the agriculture, dairy, and fisheries sectors. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that Sri Lanka will never allow its territory to be used in a way that threatens the security of India and the stability of the region.
Under Colombo Security Conclave, the two leaders discussed enhancing collaboration in maritime security, counterterrorism, cyber security, anti-trafficking, combating organized crime, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief.
