Palali-Achchuveli Main Road Reopens after 3 decades
Following directives from President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the Palali-Achchuveli main road was reopened today (01) after three decades of closure. The road, initially closed due to the prolonged 30-year civil conflict, remained inaccessible even in the 15 years following the end of the war.
Residents of the Northern Province had long called for the roadâ€™s reopening to facilitate greater mobility and regional development. Their concerns were formally raised in a discussion on October 22nd, when Northern Province Governor Nagalingam Vethanayahan, appealed directly to the President for action.
Accordingly, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake informed the security forces to investigate the existing security situation regarding the opening of this road and to carry out the related activities, and with the intervention of the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Secretary, steps were taken to open this road.
