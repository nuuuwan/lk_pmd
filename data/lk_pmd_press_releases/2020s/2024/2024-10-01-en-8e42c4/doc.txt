In the press release issued yesterday (30) by the Presidentâ€™s Media Division regarding the vehicles handed over to the Presidential Secretariat, the name listed under number 95 in the vehicle delivery table should be corrected from Udaya Shantha Gunasekara to Udayakantha Gunathilaka.
Additionally, we would like to inform you that the TOYOTA HILUX cab bearing the number PE-1580, which was temporarily assigned to Mr. Udayakantha Gunathilaka, has been returned to the Presidential Secretariat on September 23, 2024.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused to former MP Udaya Shantha Gunasekara.
