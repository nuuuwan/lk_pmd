Roads around Fort President’s House Now open to the Public

Hon. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has ordered the reopening of roads around the Colombo Fort President’s House, which had previously been closed due to roadblocks.

The President’s House and its surrounding area had been classified as a high-security zone and were closed off to the public.

However, with President Dissanayake’s appointment, all roadblocks have now been lifted.

Accordingly, Sir Baron Jayathilaka Mawatha and Janadhipathi Mawatha will be accessible to the public from tomorrow (28).
