Full Support from Exporters Essential to Achieve This Goal
– President

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the government’s aim is to create economic independence in the country, and for this, the full support of the country’s exporters is essential.

He made this remark during a discussion held at the Presidential Secretariat today (29) with senior officials from the Export Development Board and exporters.

The President highlighted the importance of establishing a single service window by integrating various government agencies and Sri Lanka Customs to facilitate export trade. He also emphasized the role of digitalization in increasing the efficiency of government agencies involved in exports.

Additionally, President Dissanayake noted that the government is focused on significant issues such as lowering energy prices, promoting foreign investments, and restructuring diplomatic service to facilitate enhancing market access.

He expressed his expectation that these goals can be achieved in a short timeframe, calling for the broad involvement of all stakeholders in the field.

Exporters from various sectors, including construction, freight transport and logistics, fish exports, information technology, gems and jewellery, printing, glass and ceramics, and spice industry products, participated in the discussion. They addressed the challenges faced by each industry as well as the export sector as a whole, and potential solutions were presented.

The conversation also covered the government’s future plans to increase export income, focusing on investment promotion, proper regulation, research and development, infrastructure development, productivity enhancement, market access, digitization, and tax concessions.

Mr. Mangala Wijesinghe, Chairman of the Export Development Board, and a group of its senior officials were present at the meeting.
