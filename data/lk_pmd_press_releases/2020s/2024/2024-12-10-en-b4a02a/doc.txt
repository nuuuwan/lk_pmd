In addition, there are several Presidential Residences under the administration of the Presidential Secretariat, situated in Colombo, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Mahiyanganaya, Anuradhapura, Kataragama, Jaffna, Embilipitiya, and Bentota. Apart from the Presidential Residences in Colombo and Kandy, which are in continuous use, the remaining Presidential residencies and the “Visumpaya” in Colombo 02, formerly the official residence of several state leaders and now managed by the Urban Development Authority, the official residence of the Prime Minister in Nuwara Eliya which is under the Prime Minister’s Office, and the aforementioned government bungalows are set to be used in a more economically productive manner.
