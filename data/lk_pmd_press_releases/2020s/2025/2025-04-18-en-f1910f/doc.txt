Fake Invitation Circulating to Attend “Siri Dalada Vandanawa” Inauguration Ceremony
A fraudulent invitation is being circulated, misleading the public to attend the inauguration ceremony of the “Siri Dalada Vandanawa” (Exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic).
This fake invitation, falsely created in the name of the Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, instructs recipients to arrive at the President’s House in Kandy to participate in the event.
No special invitations have been issued to anyone for the “Siri Dalada Vandanawa”.
Additionally, baseless claims are spreading on social media that a special (VIP) queue has been arranged for the “Siri Dalada Vandanawa” based on this forged document. These rumours are entirely false.
