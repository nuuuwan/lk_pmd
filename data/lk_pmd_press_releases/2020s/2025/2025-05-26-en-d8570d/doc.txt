Condolence Message Issued by President Anura Kumara Disanayake on the Demise of Veteran Actress Malini Fonseka

At this deeply sorrowful moment when Dr. Malini Fonseka, revered as the undisputed icon of Sri Lankan cinema and honoured as the “Queen of the Silver Screen”, takes her final leave from this world, I respectfully seek your permission to offer my own heartfelt tribute to her memory.

Some losses can be replaced. Others are difficult to fill. And then, there are those that are simply irreplaceable. The seat vacated by the Queen of Sinhala cinema is one that will remain forever empty, a permanent void in Sri Lanka’s cinematic heritage.

For over six decades, she graced film, television and stage with unmatched brilliance across the disciplines of acting, directing, producing and screenwriting. Her unwavering presence and enduring mastery across these mediums is a rare legacy.

In a country without even a formal school of cinema, Malini Fonseka ends her life’s journey as a university of cinema in her own right. Her boundless talent could only be equalled by herself. To see an artist even approach her calibre, our nation will need to dedicate several more decades of nurturing and commitment.

Difficult though it may be, this is the only fitting way to truly honour her.
Malini Fonseka was born on 30 April 1947, a remarkable year in Sri Lanka’s history. It was a time when the nation stood on the cusp of political independence and notably, the very first Sinhala film Kadawunu Poronduwa premiered on 21 January that same year.

She was born into an ordinary family, the third child among eleven siblings, in Kelaniya. At around 16 years of age, she made her stage debut in Noratha Ratha, produced by the drama society of what is now the University of Kelaniya. In 1965, her performance in the stage play Akal Wessa earned her the award for Best Actress.

Impressed by her acting, Tissa Liyanasuriya and Joe Abeywickrama selected her for the lead role in their upcoming film. That film, Punchi Baba, released in 1968, marked her cinematic debut. It is noteworthy that Mr. Tissa Liyanasuriya, who directed that film, is among us during this time of grief.

From Punchi Baba to her final film Akasa Kusum, Malini appeared in nearly 150 movies. Given the time she spent on these films, the nature of the Sri Lankan film industry and the societal expectations placed on women, the heights she achieved are nothing short of extraordinary.

Cinema is broadly classified into three streams: popular cinema, narrative cinema and artistic cinema. Malini Fonseka was a rare actress who triumphed in all three domains. In this regard, she is rightfully considered a treasure of Sinhala cinema.
I will not attempt to list all her creations or accolades here. Her radiant stardom, rare talent and exceptional skill, sharpened through tireless dedication, formed the foundation of her success. Critics unanimously highlight the range of her roles and the unmatched sensitivity with which she brought those varied characters to life.

Today, the entire nation mourns her loss with genuine grief. Her achievements were not merely personal victories, but triumphs for all Sri Lankans. The honours bestowed upon her were, in truth, honours bestowed upon the country through her.

No one, under any circumstance, can diminish or devalue her monumental contributions. As she departs from this world, both the nation and the people remember her with profound respect. She now takes her place as an immortal figure in Sri Lankan history, a memory that will never fade.

I truly feel that we are bidding farewell to a powerful force that elevated the cultural life of us all.

In this moment of mourning, we offer her the heartfelt gratitude and reverence of an entire nation.
