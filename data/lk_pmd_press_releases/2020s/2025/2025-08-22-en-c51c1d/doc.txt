New Diplomatic Heads Meet President

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake underscored that ambassadors carry the crucial responsibility of strengthening Sri Lanka’s image on the international stage.

He made these remarks this afternoon (22) at the Presidential Secretariat during a meeting with newly appointed Heads of Missions.

Congratulating the new heads of missions, the President urged them to serve Sri Lankans living abroad fairly and without discrimination, while promptly addressing the issues faced by the expatriate community.

Highlighting that Sri Lanka is on a path towards economic stability, the President stressed the importance of understanding the country’s present needs and challenges. He noted that embassies play a pivotal role in generating foreign income through four key areas: investment, exports, tourism and foreign employment.

The President further highlighted that all foreign exchange channels, which play a vital role in achieving external stability in the economy, are connected to embassies, and they can significantly contribute to the Sri Lankan economy through these channels. Furthermore, the President stressed the importance of entering into free trade agreements and preferential trade arrangements with foreign nations are a timely priority.
