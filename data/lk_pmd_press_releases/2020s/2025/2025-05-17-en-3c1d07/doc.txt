Clarification on Misleading Reports Concerning the Tender Sale of Vehicles Owned by the Presidential Secretariat

It has been observed that various false claims are being circulated in certain mainstream media and especially social media platforms regarding the second phase of the vehicle sale conducted through a tender process by the Presidential Secretariat on May 15.

All procedures related to this sale were carried out in accordance with the Asset Management Circular 05/2024.

The tender sale adhered to the government’s open tender procedure, with the announcement for tenders being publicly released on April 23, 2025, via mass media, the Presidential Secretariat’s website and newspaper advertisements. A total of 108 prospective bidders obtained tender applications upon payment and submitted their bids by the closing date of May 15, 2025. The bid opening took place on the same day at 11:00 a.m. and the sale of vehicles was conducted accordingly, adhering fully compliance with the established guidelines.

Vehicles were awarded to the highest bidders whose offers exceeded the government’s estimated valuation. However, in some cases, the bids received did not meet the government’s minimum valuation. As a result, out of the 26 vehicles offered for sale, only 17 were sold. The remaining 9 vehicles received bids below the government valuation and were therefore not sold.

Accordingly, the details of the vehicles sold during the tender process held on May 15, 2025, are as follows:



The following vehicles were not sold during the tender process as the bids received did not meet the government’s officially assessed valuations:

It appears that a certain organized group is deliberately generating and disseminating false information through media regarding the recent vehicle sale conducted through the tender process.

This unrest clearly indicates that specific corrupt factions, which previously exploited and misused luxury vehicles acquired and funded by public resources during earlier administrations, are now showing signs of desperation after losing their privileges. These individuals are now resorting to attacking the government over any matter that comes their way, using their affiliated media channels and hired social media propagandists.

In this context, the dissemination of false news reports and the misuse of social media are deeply concerning. Complaints have already been lodged with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) against those engaged in spreading such malicious and misleading propaganda aimed at deceiving the public.
