– President
President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that the life of His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith serves as an exemplary model in an era when the moral and spiritual values of society are in decline.
The President made these remarks yesterday (07), delivering a speech at the felicitation ceremony organized by the Archdiocese of Colombo to mark the 50th Ordination Anniversary of His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith’s sacred priesthood. The event was held at the Archbishop’s House in Colombo.
The President stated that His Eminence is deeply engaged in a tireless mission to uphold social harmony and spiritual upliftment. He is a statesman who has rendered a significant service to the country, a theological scholar capable of articulating the teachings of the Bible with clarity, a powerful orator with the ability to awaken society and above all, a true humanitarian whose influence extends beyond these roles.
The President further affirmed that every possible step will be taken to ensure justice for the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks, without allowing the passage of time to obscure the truth. He emphasized that this is a challenge the government must confront, even within its own institutions and no matter how difficult it may be, justice must be served.
Addressing the gathering, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith reflected on his 50 years of priestly service and commended President Anura Kumara Disanayake for his success in ending a 75-year era of autocratic rule. He also expressed appreciation for the President’s efforts to dismantle a political culture rooted in spreading division among ethnic communities and emphasized the need for a new approach as the country moves towards becoming a prosperous nation.
On this occasion, to mark the 50th Ordination Anniversary of His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith’s priesthood, a commemorative stamp and first-day cover were officially presented to the President.
