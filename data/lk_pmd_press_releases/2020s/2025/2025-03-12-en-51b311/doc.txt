Students from Several Schools Visit the Presidential Secretariat and President’s House
A group of students from Hambantota St. Mary’s National School, Nakulugamuwa Moraketiara Junior College and Nalanda College, Colombo 10, visited the Presidential Secretariat and the President’s House today (12) as part of an educational tour.
This initiative provided schoolchildren the opportunity to explore the Presidential Secretariat (formerly the Old Parliament Building) and the President’s House as part of their academic field trip.
Coinciding with the tour, students were also educated about the “Clean Sri Lanka” program, a key government initiative. Mr. K.M.N. Kumarasinghe, Senior Additional Secretary to the President, briefed the students on the objectives and implementation of the program, emphasizing its role in enhancing their knowledge, skills and attitudes.
Meanwhile, Media Adviser to the President Mr. Chandana Sooriyabandara highlighted the legacy of Mr. C.W.W. Kannangara, stating that his vision serves as a guiding light for the future generation of students. He further noted that many developed nations achieved progress through collective citizen efforts, stressing that every individual must fulfill their responsibilities diligently to contribute to national development.
As a symbolic gesture, a valuable plant was gifted to each participating school for cultivation within their premises. The presentation was carried out by the President’s Media Director General Mr. Prasanna Perera and Mr. Anuruddha Lokuhapuarachchi, Director of International Media and Strategic Communications at the President’s Media Division (PMD).
The event was attended by the principals, academic staff, parents and other distinguished guests.
