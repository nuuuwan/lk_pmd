“Clean Sri Lanka” Urban Forest Project Launches Near Kelani Bridge

Under the Clean Sri Lanka Programme, the first phase of the Urban Forest Project was launched this morning (30) near the Kelaniya Bridge in Peliyagoda.

This initiative was implemented in collaboration with S-lon Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of The Capital Maharaja Group, aligning with the “Tree Guardian” project. It also coincided with today’s (30) Zero Waste Day, further reinforcing its environmental significance.
Guided by the Presidential Secretariat, key government and private sector stakeholders, including the Road Development Authority, the Urban Development Authority and the Colombo Municipal Council, partnered in the project’s execution.
As part of the initiative, trees were planted on state-owned land between the Nawaloka Roundabout and the New Kelani Bridge in Peliyagods, transforming the area into an attractive urban forest plantation.

A unique aspect of this project is the assignment of responsibility for the protection and maintenance of the planted trees to various community groups, such as school students, university students and Daham Pasal (Religious School) students.
Specifically, the students of Dharmawijaya Daham Pasala in Peliyagoda were entrusted with the care and preservation of the trees planted near the Kelaniya Bridge.

Additionally, a mobile application (APP) has been introduced to continuously monitor and update the growth and condition of the trees, as well as track the progress of their respective caretakers.
Delivering the keynote address at the ceremony, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake emphasized that this project is not merely a reforestation initiative but a social, environmental and ethical movement closely linked to the objectives of the Clean Sri Lanka Programme.

Highlighting the historical challenges faced by tree planting projects initiated by previous governments, he noted that many such initiatives have struggled to achieve long-term success. However, he expressed confidence that, due to its strong public participation, the Clean Sri Lanka Programme would ensure the Urban Forest Project evolves into a sustainable and enduring initiative.
Attending the event as a Guest of Honour, Minister of Power and Energy Kumara Jayakody emphasized that the concept of green cities has gained global attention, with increasing focus on urban forests.
The Minister highlighted the importance of fostering a mindset shift among the public to achieve these environmental goals effectively. He stressed that assigning responsibility to the people in implementing this project is crucial for its success.
Furthermore, he pointed out that greater attention is now being directed toward renewable energy sources as part of efforts to create a sustainable environmental system.

Minister of Urban Development, Housing, and Construction Anura Karunatilaka, who also participated in the event, noted that while urbanization has made life more convenient, it has also resulted in significant losses.
He explained that Sri Lanka is now experiencing the negative consequences of urbanization, including environmental pollution, water contamination, air pollution and rising global temperatures. In searching for solutions to these challenges, initiatives such as urban forest projects play a vital role.
The event was also attended by Minister of Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment Upali Pannilage, along with S.C. Weerasekara, Operations Manager of The Capital Maharaja Group and Senior Additional Secretary to the President, Russell Appuhamy, who addressed the gathering.

Among the other distinguished attendees were Senior Additional Secretary to the President Roshan Gamage, Additional Secretary to the President S.P.C. Sugeeshwara, Chief Executive Officer of S-lon Lanka (Pvt) Ltd Nalin Jayawardena and Chief Executive Officer of PE Plus (Pvt) Ltd Shehan Amarasinghe.
Additionally, officials from the Colombo and Peliyagoda Municipal Councils, the Urban Development Authority and the Road Development Authority, along with Acting Inspector General of Police Priyantha Weerasooriya and senior officers from the Army and Police, were also present at the event.
