Clean Sri Lanka Campaign Continues in Kandy alongside Siri Dalada Vandanawa
As part of the Clean Sri Lanka program held in conjunction with the Siri Dalada Vandanawa, an initiative focused on the proper disposal of waste was carried out today (26) for the ninth consecutive day. The program centred around the main access roads leading to the
Dalada Vandanawa and surrounding areas.
Officials from the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat, along with several volunteer groups comprising both youth and adults, actively participated in this effort.
The program, organized with the aim of fostering a positive attitude among the public towards proper waste disposal, received strong public support and was successfully implemented.
Over the past several days, similar activities have been conducted around the historic Sri Dalada Maligawa premises, aligned with the Siri Dalada Vandanawa.
