Fulfilling Our Civic Responsibility for a Cleaner Sri Lanka
– An Appeal to Devotees Visiting the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic
The Clean Sri Lanka programme respectfully urges all devotees visiting the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) for the veneration of sacred relics, to avoid bringing non-biodegradable items, such as polythene and to prioritize cleanliness within and around the temple premises.
Visitors are kindly reminded to dispose of waste responsibly, using only the designated disposal areas.
As a flagship government programme, Clean Sri Lanka seeks to inspire a collective awakening in environmental, social and ethical consciousness, striving to uplift the nation towards a cleaner and more responsible society.
This programme places special emphasis on creating a waste-free environment and encouraging proper waste management practices.
In alignment with the commencement of the Siri Dalada Dekma (Sacred Relic exposition), a series of activities under the Clean Sri Lanka programme have been launched around the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic to support this cause.
