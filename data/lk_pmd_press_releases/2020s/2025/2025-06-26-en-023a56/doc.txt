“Clean Sri Lanka” Initiative Launches School Programme focused on Road Safety and Security Awarenes
Under the “Clean Sri Lanka” initiative, a new programme has been launched to enhance public awareness and attitudes toward road safety, with the aim of decreasing daily road accidents.
As part of this effort, two awareness programmes titled “Clean Steps – Safety Roads – Be United for Road Safety” were held today (26) at the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Auditorium of the University of Ruhuna and near the Matara Beach Park.
With the support of the Sri Lanka Police, a road safety demonstration was conducted near Matara Beach Park this morning from 8:00 AM, attended by approximately 1,300 students from schools in the Matara educational zone.
The initiative is designed to cultivate road discipline among schoolchildren from a young age, guiding them to become responsible and law-abiding citizens in the future. Furthermore, it aims to enhance school road safety clubs by raising awareness about traffic regulations, accident prevention and responsible conduct.
