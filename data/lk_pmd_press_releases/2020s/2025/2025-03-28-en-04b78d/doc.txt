50% Discounted food packs for 800,000 Families on the ‘Aswesuma’ Waiting List This New Year

In order to reduce the cost of living and guarantee food security during the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Lanka Sathosa will offer discounted essential food item packs to 800,000 families who are currently on the “Aswesuma” welfare benefit scheme waiting list.

Accordingly, the relief pack containing essential food items valued at Rs. 5,000 will be available at a 50% discount, allowing eligible recipients to purchase it for Rs. 2,500. For individuals in areas not covered by Lanka Sathosa, the packs will be distributed through selected cooperative outlets (COOPFED).

This exclusive discount is offered to 812,753 families who are currently registered on the ‘Aswesuma’ waiting list as eligible beneficiaries.

The programme will be implemented from April 1 to April 13, 2025, with a strict monitoring mechanism in place to ensure that the benefits reach the intended recipients.

The programme launched under the theme “Sathutin Sathosin”, is a joint effort by the Ministry of Finance, Food Policy and Security Committee, and the Cooperative Retail Network.

As the first Sinhala and Tamil New Year under the current government, this initiative aims to ensure that essential food items remain affordable and accessible for everyone, preventing shortages during the festive season.
