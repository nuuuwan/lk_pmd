    "I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear about the tragic bus accident that occurred this morning (11) in the Garadiella area along the Nuwara Eliya\u2013Gampola main road in Kotmale.",
    "The rising number of road accidents across the country has become a matter of serious concern for the government. We are currently taking steps to develop a comprehensive and sustainable strategy to prevent such incidents. We believe that stricter enforcement of existing traffic laws, along with efforts to improve drivers\u2019 attitudes and awareness, can significantly reduce the frequency of these tragedies. In line with this, a dedicated program is already being planned under the \u201cClean Sri Lanka\u201d initiative.",
    "I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives in this devastating accident. I also wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.",
    "I wish to assure the public that instructions have already been issued to the relevant security and health authorities to ensure that all necessary medical facilities are in place and that prompt action is taken to provide treatment and care to the injured."
