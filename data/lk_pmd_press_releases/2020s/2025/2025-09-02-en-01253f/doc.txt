President Launches Series of Development Projects in the North for the Second Consecutive Day

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is scheduled to inaugurate and participate in several development programmes in the Northern Province today (02), marking the second consecutive day of such initiatives.

Coinciding with World Coconut Day, the President will preside over the launch of the “Ratama Saru Karai Nirathuru – Kapthuru Saviya” Northern Coconut Triangle project this morning in Puthukudiyiruppu.

The programme, which begins with the objective of cultivating 16,000 acres of coconut in the Northern Province by 2025, is expected to expand to 50,000 acres by 2027.

Alongside this initiative, the first model coconut garden in the North will be launched in Palai under the patronage of the President. The President will also inaugurate a coconut-based products exhibition organized by the Coconut Development Authority, held near Puthukkudiyiruppu Central College.

Meanwhile, President Dissanayake will also preside over the commencement of construction of the Vadduvakal Bridge in Mullaitivu District today (02).

Located along the Paranthan – Karachchi – Mullaitivu Road near the Nandikadal Lagoon, the bridge carries over 3,000 vehicles daily. Owing to the lack of maintenance for many years, it has become severely unsafe.

Accordingly, under the Road Development Authority, the bridge will be reconstructed as a new two-lane bridge at a cost of Rs. 1.4 billion in public funds.
