All Services of the President’s Fund to Be Made Fully Accessible Online from June 21

The acceptance of applications for medical assistance under the President’s Fund through Divisional Secretariats island wide commenced on February 7. Following the successful implementation of that initiative, preparations have now been completed to expand the digital system to include all other services offered by the Fund.

Accordingly, the public will be able to apply online via any Divisional Secretariat across the country for a wide range of services provided under the President’s Fund. These include assistance for poverty alleviation, provision of educational scholarships, recognition of students demonstrating academic excellence, support for individuals with special needs, relief assistance for children affected by wild elephant conflict, recognition of individuals for their national service or contributions to the country, Emergency and disaster relief.

This digital transformation marks a significant milestone, as it enables people across Sri Lanka to access services of the President’s Fund from anywhere in the country for the first time in its 47-year history, which had previously been limited to Colombo-based operations.

This move comes as a result of a decision taken by the Board of Governors of the President’s Fund, chaired by the President. It is expected to broaden access to assistance for a larger number of beneficiaries while also minimizing opportunities for misuse of the Fund.
