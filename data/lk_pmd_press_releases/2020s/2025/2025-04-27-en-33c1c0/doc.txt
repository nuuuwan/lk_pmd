Clean Sri Lanka Initiative Successfully Purifies Kandy City with Public Participation
As part of the Clean Sri Lanka programme, the historic city of Kandy was thoroughly cleansed today (27) with the collective efforts of devotees visiting the Siri Dalada Vandanawa (Sacred Tooth Relic veneration), alongside residents and volunteers from the area.
The initiative, spearheaded by the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat, saw the active participation of several volunteer groups comprising both youth and adults, as well as officials from the organisation.
Under this campaign, the entirety of Kandy city has been successfully sanitised, reinforcing the importance of proper waste disposal and fostering a positive shift in public attitudes towards cleanliness. The programme’s success was made possible by the unwavering support of the local community.
This effort follows a series of similar cleanliness drives conducted in recent days, centred around the historic Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic), coinciding with the sacred Dalada Vandanawa.
