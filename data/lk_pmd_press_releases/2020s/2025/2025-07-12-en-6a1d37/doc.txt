Students from Mawatagama Central College, Kurunegala and Sri Koneswara Hindu College, Trincomalee Visit the Presidential Secretariat and President’s House

A group of students from Mawatagama Central College in Kurunegala and Sri Koneswara Hindu College in Trincomalee had the opportunity to participate in the “Vision” programme organized by the Presidential Secretariat yesterday (11), as part of their educational excursion.

This programme is jointly conducted by the Presidential Secretariat, the Ministry of Education and the Communications Department of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, with the aim of educating school children.

As part of the programme, the students were also briefed on the “Clean Sri Lanka” initiative and its conceptual importance in promoting environmental consciousness.

Delivering an engaging lecture to the students, Senior Advisor to the President on Science and technology Prof. Gomika Udugamasooriya emphasized the importance of not limiting oneself to a single field of knowledge, but rather exploring all areas through experimentation from a young age. He also highlighted how life’s challenges can be overcome by treating every experience as a subject of inquiry and learning.

Reinforcing the importance of environmental conservation, valuable saplings were donated to the participating schools.

Also in attendance were Senior Additional Secretary to the President Mr. K.N.M. Kumarasinghe, Director of the Tri-Forces Coordination Unit of the Presidential Secretariat Air Commodore Asiri Gallage, Assistant Director Major Nadika Dangolla, as well as teachers from both Mawatagama Central College and Sri Koneswara Hindu College.
