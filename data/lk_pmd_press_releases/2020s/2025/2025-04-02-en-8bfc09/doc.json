    "The Food Policy and Security Committee has recommended the importation of rice in the near future to ensure an uninterrupted supply for consumers.",
    "A notable increase in rice prices has been observed in the market, along with reports of shortages in certain rice varieties, despite the current harvest season.",
    "Given this situation, discussions were held regarding the need for the Cabinet to prioritize the maintenance of sufficient stock levels through rice imports.",
    "The Committee, chaired by Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation K.D. Lalkantha and Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Vasantha Samarasinghe, convened for the fifth time at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday (01). The meeting aimed to formulate policy decisions to ensure food security.",
    "During the discussions, it was revealed that due to excessive rainfall this year, crop damage occurred on two occasions, leading to a significant reduction in the expected harvest.",
    "Furthermore, during the meeting it was stated that the improper use of rice for animal feed is another major reason contributing to the rice shortage. As a result, the Committee also focused on the importation of broken rice for animal feed and the use of alternative feeds to mitigate the impact on livestock production.",
    "Accordingly, the Food Policy and Security Committee approved the formation of a Committee, led by the Director General of Agriculture, to oversee the importation of the required quantity of broken rice through proper mechanisms.",
    "Secretary to the Prime Minister Pradeep Saputhanthri, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Kapila Janaka Bandara, and other members of the Food Policy and Security Committee, including Ministry Secretaries, also participated in the discussions."
