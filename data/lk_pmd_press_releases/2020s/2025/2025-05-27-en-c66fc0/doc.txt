The ceremonial inaugural session of the Student Parliament of Helena Wijewardena Balika Maha Vidyalaya, Kelaniya, was held today (27) at the historic Parliamentary Chamber of the Presidential Secretariat.

This initiative was conducted in line with the ‘Vision’ programme series jointly implemented by the Presidential Secretariat, the Ministry of Education and the Department of Communication of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, aimed at nurturing leadership among schoolchildren.

The members of the Helena Wijewardena Balika Maha Vidyalaya Student Parliament were briefed with a special awareness session on the history of parliamentary traditions, the role of Parliament and leadership skills. The session was conducted by Attorney-at-Law Chaminda Kularatne, Chief of Staff and Deputy Secretary General of the Parliament of Sri Lanka.

Following the commencement of the ceremonial session, the Speaker and Members of the Student Parliament took their official oaths.

Speaking at the event, Media Advisor to the President Chandana Sooriyabandara emphasized that schools play a crucial role in building a society that respects the values of others, rather than one that glorifies negativity. He noted that such an environment fosters responsible citizenship and warned that if attitudes remain unchanged, the country would continue to face serious challenges.

He emphasized the significance of nurturing a generation that can confront physical, mental and social challenges with resilience, one that remains steadfast in the face of adversity. He stated that children should be educated to strongly say “no” to anything unsafe.

Certificates were also presented to members of the Student Parliament, and Bank of Ceylon student savings accounts were opened for them as part of the proceedings.

Also in attendance were Legal Advisor to the President J.M. Wijebandara, Senior Additional Secretary to the President K.N.M. Kumarasinghe, Principal of Helena Wijewardena Balika Maha Vidyalaya R.K. Gunathilaka, along with teachers, students and parents.
