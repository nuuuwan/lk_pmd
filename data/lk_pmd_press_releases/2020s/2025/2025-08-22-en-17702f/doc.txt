The meeting extensively reviewed the progress of projects implemented in 2025 under the allocations of the Ministry of Plantation and Community Infrastructure by its 29 institutions, while also scrutinizing the challenges encountered and the plans ahead.

Emphasizing the importance of developing coconut cultivation, the President instructed officials to identify lands suitable for commercial-scale plantations and promote their development.

He further highlighted that priority should be given to increasing the productivity of existing coconut plantations rather than focusing solely on new lands. The President also stressed the need to raise public awareness about existing laws and regulations governing the efficient use of privately-owned coconut estates.

The President additionally instructed the preparation of a plan for the proper utilization of underused lands belonging to the Department of Public Trustee.

Discussions also covered the progress of estate housing projects, the development of plantation infrastructure, the establishment of smart classrooms in estate schools and community empowerment programmes in plantation sector. The President directed officials to conduct a thorough study of the smart classroom initiative and present a report.

Attention was also drawn to research activities related to tea and rubber sectors, as well as efforts to enhance the quality and global competitiveness of Sri Lankan cinnamon products. The President noted the potential for expanding cinnamon cultivation in the Western Province as a means to boost productivity and maximize land use.

Highlighting that many industries are currently operating at under-capacity due to the artificially created domestic market, the President emphasized the importance of carrying out a proper assessment and formulating a strategic plan for industrial development in Sri Lanka.

The discussion also addressed the identification of overlapping functions within institutions under the Ministry, with instructions to merge relevant entities and dissolve those deemed unnecessary.

Further, increasing export income from the plantation sector and meeting desired targets were key points of discussion.
