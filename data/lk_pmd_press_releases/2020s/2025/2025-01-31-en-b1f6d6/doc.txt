The President highlighted that while the government has the authority to acquire land anywhere in the country for development projects or security purposes, it is imperative that alternative land is provided to those affected.

President Disanayake made these remarks during the Jaffna District Coordination Committee (DCC) Meeting held today (31) at the Jaffna District Secretariat.

He also stressed that the Jaffna President’s House will be fully repurposed for a project of greater significance to the people of the region. He urged officials to submit suitable proposals for this initiative.

The President instructed officials to investigate and take swift action regarding reports that families displaced by the war are still residing in the Northern Province.

He also noted that a committee, led by the Secretary to the Prime Minister, has identified approximately 30,000 vacancies in state institutions. He assured that these vacancies would be filled in accordance with the established recruitment process, ensuring opportunities for university graduates as well.

Additionally, the President announced that Tamil-speaking youth will be given greater opportunities to apply for vacancies in the Police Department and encouraged them to come forward for recruitment.

The government has also planned to implement a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the transportation system in the Northern Province. This includes launching a joint bus operation project between the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and private bus operators. Furthermore, attention has been directed toward increasing the frequency of train services in the region.

The President stated that three new industrial zones will be established in Paranthan, Mankulam, and Kankesanthurai to improve the living standards of the people in the Northern Province. He also extended an invitation to Sri Lankans who left the country due to the war to invest in these projects.

The government is prioritizing the Northern Province in its development plans, ensuring targeted initiatives for the region, the President emphasized.

He further revealed that with an estimated 2.5 million tourists expected to visit Sri Lanka next year, the government will identify and promote new tourist attractions in the Northern Province to boost tourism in the region.
