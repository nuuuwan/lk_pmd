President Engages in Discussions with FUTA

A meeting between President Anura Kumara Disanayake and academics of the Federation of University Teachers’ Association (FUTA) was held this morning (13) at the Presidential Secretariat.

During the discussion, the academics briefed the President on the challenges they are currently facing, and potential solutions to address these issues were examined.

It was highlighted that Sri Lanka is presently engaged in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, which requires the government to adhere to the recommended guidelines and parameters. Accordingly, this year’s budget proposals have been formulated with a focus on revenue and expenditure limitations, prioritizing education and healthcare. It was also highlighted that despite these financial limitations, the government has implemented the largest-ever increase in the basic salary of public sector employees.

The President assured that the government is fully aware of the challenges faced by all professional groups and is committed to addressing them sensitively while safeguarding the rights of all individuals.

Prime Minister and Minister of Education Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Minister of Urban Development, Construction and Housing Anura Karunatilake, President of the Federation of University Teachers’ Association Dr. Anuruddha Karunaratne, Secretary Senior Lecturer Charudatta B. Ilangasinghe and several officials from the association also attended the meeting.
