President’s Fund Recognizes GCE A/L Top Achievers
The President’s Fund has organized a provincial-level awards programme to honour outstanding students who excelled in the 2023/2024 GCE Advanced Level (A/L) examinations at the district level.
Under this initiative, 60 top-performing students from each district selected based on exceptional results across all subject streams will receive financial scholarships and certificates of achievement.
The selection process is conducted in collaboration with the Department of Examinations and the University Grants Commission (UGC), using official results published for the 2023/2024 exams.
The first phase of this programme will recognize distinguished students from the Northern Province who achieved top results in the 2023 A/L examinations. The awards ceremony is scheduled to take place in Kilinochchi on June 22, 2025, with all preparations now finalized.
Accordingly, the exceptional students from the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya who performed remarkably in the 2023 GCE Advanced Level Examination will be honoured at the event.
Meanwhile, preparations are underway to hold award ceremonies in the other provinces shortly as well.
