A Programme to Educate Schoolchildren About Road Safety and Security under the “Clean Sri Lanka” Initiative

A programme aimed at enhancing public knowledge and attitudes towards ensuring road safety by preventing daily road accidents has been launched under the “Clean Sri Lanka” initiative.

Accordingly, two awareness programmes titled “Clean Steps – Safety Roads – Be United for Road Safety”, focusing on road safety and security for schoolchildren, were held today (26) at the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Auditorium in University of Ruhuna and near the Matara Beach Park.

With the support of the Sri Lanka Police, a road safety exhibition was held near the Matara Beach Park from 8.00 a.m. today. Approximately 1,300 students from schools in the Matara education zone participated in the event.

The objective of this programme is to teach road discipline and encourage adherence to traffic laws among schoolchildren from an early age, shaping them into law-abiding and responsible citizens in the future.

Furthermore, the programme seeks to strengthen school road safety committees by increasing awareness of traffic regulations, reducing accidents and encouraging responsible conduct on the roads.
