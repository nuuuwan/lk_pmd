Project to Convert Discarded Barrels into Standardized Waste Bins Launches by CEYPETCO and Clean Sri Lanka

On the occasion of World Environment Day today (05), a project to manufacture and distribute standardized waste bins made from discarded barrels was launched in the Muturajawela area by Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO).

This initiative is implemented jointly by CEYPETCO and the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat.

The barrels have been carefully sorted to separate combustible materials and plastics and converted into waste bins accordingly. Under the first phase of the project, CEYPETCO plans to distribute 150 recycled barrels as waste bins. The organization has also agreed to supply additional bins made from combustible and plastic materials as needed in the future.

Director of the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat Isuru Anuradha, along with officials from both the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat and CEYPETCO, participated in the event.

Meanwhile, the Lanka Mineral Oil Corporation Limited, in collaboration with the Clean Sri Lanka program, also launched a tree-planting program in the Muturajawela area today, in observance of World Environment Day.

The event was attended by senior officials including CEYPETCO Chairman, D.J.A.S. Rajakaruna, Managing Director Dr. Mayura Neththikumara, Acting Deputy General Manager Samantha Gunawardhana, as well as officials from the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat.
