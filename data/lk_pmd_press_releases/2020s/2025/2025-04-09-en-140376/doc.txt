Prevention of Corruption will not be passed on to the Next Generation

• Enforcing the Law Against Corruption is Not Political Revenge but a Moral Duty
• The Law Will Be Strictly Enforced Against the Official Mechanism that Engages in Corruption
– President says at the Launch of the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan

President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that since assuming office, the current government has taken decisive steps to free the process of combating bribery and corruption from political interference. He emphasised that while the political mechanism has been liberated from engaging in such crimes, it is now the responsibility of the administrative machinery operating beneath that political structure to fall in line and correct its course without delay.

He explained that a grace period of six months has already been provided for the state officials to adjust to this new direction. The President firmly warned that if the public service mechanism fails to act appropriately within this period, the government will not hesitate to take firm legal action against those officials from May onwards.

President Disanayake expressed these views today (09), participating in the launch of the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan 2025–2029, held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo.

The President pointed out that bribery and corruption have destroyed the dignity and values of Sri Lanka’s state administration and caused the nation to fall behind for decades in the eyes of the world. He reiterated that enforcing the law against these crimes is not an act of political revenge but a profound human responsibility.

He observed that over the past six months of the present government, no section of the public service has been allowed to collapse and that if officials continue to resist change, the government will proceed to remove and replace them after May.

The President stressed the need to build a society that respects the law and fears wrongdoing, adding that conducting lectures or workshops alone would not suffice in achieving this goal. He emphasised that people must practically witness that any person who commits a crime will be subjected to punishment under the law.

President Disanayake noted that corruption in Sri Lanka ranges from minor bribery, such as obtaining medicine through corrupt means at a rural dispensary, to grave financial crimes like looting the Central Bank. He stressed that although corruption may appear to start small, it has expanded to deeply inhumane levels.

He further accused previous rulers of safeguarding and protecting those engaged in corrupt activities, allowing such practices to spread from village-level institutions to the highest financial institutions in the country.

He also revealed that within several state administrative institutions and even among certain bodies responsible for enforcing the law, criminal networks consisting of organised corrupt officials and underworld elements have been operating, creating systemic webs of theft and fraud. He confirmed that these criminal networks have already been identified and assured that measures will be implemented in the future to dismantle and eliminate them.

President Disanayake solemnly pledged that the responsibility of eradicating bribery and corruption will not be passed on to the next generation but will be resolved within this generation itself, under the leadership of the present government.

Drawing a comparison with India, which gained independence a year before Sri Lanka, the President noted that through a consistent national policy framework, India has successfully achieved space exploration and built a massive workforce in the software industry. In stark contrast, he pointed out that Sri Lanka, due to poor decisions made by its political leadership, was declared a bankrupt state in 2022.

He further stated that the current government has taken on the responsibility of leading Sri Lanka towards the international stage through a national policy framework that ensures transparency and accountability for every rupee spent from public funds.

The President added that by implementing this framework, it is possible to build public trust in law enforcement and judicial institutions and that it must be made clear to the people that there will be no mechanism available for anyone to escape the law after committing a crime.

He stated that the purpose of the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan 2025-2029 is to guide the country towards becoming a nation of integrity. The government plans to establish internal control units within all state institutions, under the leadership of the Presidential Secretariat and implement a system for monitoring these units through digital technology to ensure accountability and transparency.

The Action Plan has been designed around four key strategic priority areas: prevention and education, public participation, institutional strengthening and the enforcement of law along with reforms in law and policy.

The President highlighted that eliminating bribery and corruption is one of the most decisive factors in a country’s development and progress. In Sri Lanka, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has been identified as the leading state institution entrusted with strengthening this mechanism. Accordingly, it was recognised that a robust national anti-corruption policy that operates across all sectors is essential to creating a corruption-free society.

In preparing this Action Plan, CIABOC engaged all relevant stakeholders by conducting extensive programmes at both national and provincial levels. A broad public consultation process was carried out, including a comprehensive survey to assess public opinion on corruption through media announcements in all three languages and via social media networks.

This process gathered proposals from a diverse range of participants, including Members of Parliament, judges, state officials, the private sector, international organisations, civil society organisations, community-based organisations, religious groups, persons with special needs, media professionals, youth, children and the general public. Additionally, foreign state experiences and suggestions from various groups across all provinces were taken into consideration when formulating the Action Plan.

By implementing this National Anti-Corruption Action Plan, the government hopes to foster a committed citizenry determined to combat corruption, a political will fully supportive of this effort, a comprehensive legal framework and a disciplined, transparent public service across all sectors, with the shared vision of building a country of integrity for future generations.

Addressing the event, the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, HE ISOMATA Akio, stated that Corruption remains a great challenge for many countries, including Sri Lanka as it undermines economic growth, weakens public trust in government institutions and discourages foreign investment. However, he noted that due to the reform initiatives of the present government, investors are once again showing increasing interest in Sri Lanka.

Ambassador ISOMATA Akio further stated that Japan has always believed that transparency and good governance are fundamental pillars for sustainable economic development and therefore, has supported anti-corruption initiatives globally for over a decade.

Meanwhile, the UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka, Ms. Azusa Kubota, stated that according to Sri Lanka’s first-ever National Taxpayer Perception Survey conducted last year, 84% of respondents indicated that corruption directly affects their willingness to pay taxes.

She further noted that corruption deters investment, increases the cost of doing business, undermines sustainable development and human security, and causes an estimated annual loss of USD 1.3 trillion for developing countries.

Referring to the Budget Speech delivered by the President, Ms. Kubota emphasised that the State must be accountable for every cent of taxpayers’ money and stated that this Action Plan would serve as a roadmap for transforming Sri Lankan society.



The event was attended by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Murdu Nirupa Bidushinie Fernando; the Attorney General, Parinda Ranasinghe PC; the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake; the Chairman of CIABOC, former High Court Judge Neil Iddawela; the Director General of CIABOC, R.S.A. Dissanayake; the Commanders of the Tri-Forces; the Inspector General of Police; senior officials from the security forces and a large number of state officials.
