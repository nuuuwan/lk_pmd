President Dissanayake Chairs Pre-Budget Talks on Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation

A pre-budget discussion for the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation was held this morning (13) at the Presidential Secretariat, chaired by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The meeting focused on reviewing the 2025 budget allocations and formulating proposals for the 2026 budget.

President Dissanayake reviewed each transport sector individually, including highways, expressways and rural roads and examined the budget allocations for ports, their operations, the utilisation of funds and future development plans.

He directed officials to prepare measures to ensure reliable services on rural bus routes, even if the government has to bear the cost, noting that these routes often operate at a loss but remain vital to the public.

Underscoring the importance of strategic investment, the President stressed that upcoming budget planning should prioritise sectors essential to national development. He urged officials to focus on initiatives that would enable the transport, highways, ports and civil aviation sectors to make a greater contribution to the economy.

The meeting was attended by Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation Bimal Ratnayake; Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways Dr. Prasanna Gunasena; Deputy Minister of Ports and Civil Aviation Engineer Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku; Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake; Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma; Senior Additional Secretaries to the President Russell Aponsu and Kapila Janaka Bandara; along with other senior officials from the Ministry.
