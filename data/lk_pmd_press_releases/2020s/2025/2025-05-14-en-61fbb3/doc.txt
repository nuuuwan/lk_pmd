Among the vehicles to be auctioned are 01 BMW car, 02 Ford Everest Jeeps, 01 Hyundai Terracan Jeep, 02 Land Rover Jeep 02, 01 Mitsubishi Montero, 03 Nissan Patrol vehicles, 02 Nissan cars, 01 Porsche Cayenne, 05 SsangYong Rexton Jeeps, 01 Toyota Land Cruiser Sahara, 06 V08 vehicles and 01 Mitsubishi Rosa air-conditioned bus.

Previously, under the first phase of this auction, 14 luxury vehicles, six decommissioned vehicles, and various spare parts were sold.

This initiative is part of the government’s effort to reduce expenditure and promote financial responsibility. In the first phase, 15 vehicles, including nine Defender jeeps, were successfully auctioned.

The vehicles being auctioned tomorrow are not part of the official vehicle fleet assigned to the regular staff of the Presidential Secretariat. Instead, they were used by advisors and staff appointed by the former President under Article 41(1) of the Constitution during his term in office.
