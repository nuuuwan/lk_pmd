– President

President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that it is the responsibility of ambassadors to convey Sri Lanka’s ongoing political transformation to the international community and to elevate the country’s image on the global stage.

The President made these remarks during a meeting held today (15) at the Presidential Secretariat with the newly appointed state diplomats assigned to Foreign Service.

He invited the newly appointed Diplomats to act as stakeholders of this political transformation and contribute actively in representing Sri Lanka’s new direction on the global stage.

President Disanayake also instructed the diplomats to pay special attention to the welfare of Sri Lankans living abroad.

The President emphasized that all citizens must be treated fairly and equally, without any discrimination, when providing consular services.

President Anura Kumara Disanayake stressed that Sri Lankan missions abroad should serve as a home for Sri Lankans and urged diplomats to carry out their duties efficiently in service to the nation.

President Disanayake reiterated that expanding opportunities to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and identifying new market opportunities for entrepreneurs operating in Sri Lanka are also core responsibilities of the diplomatic service.

He stated that inviting foreign investors and tourists to Sri Lanka is a key duty assigned to Diplomats in the national effort to revive the economy and assured that the government stands ready to extend its full support to enable them to fulfill this mandate.
