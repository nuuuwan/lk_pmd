Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Arrive in Sri Lanka Tomorrow

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka tomorrow evening (April 4) for a three-day state visit at the invitation of President Anura Kumara Disanayake.

Reaffirming the theme “Friendship of Centuries, Commitment to a Prosperous Future,” Prime Minister Modi’s visit aims to strengthen the longstanding ties between Sri Lanka and India. He will be accompanied by a delegation that includes Indian Minister of External Affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar.

The official welcoming ceremony will take place on the morning of April 5 at Independence Square in Colombo.

During his visit, Prime Minister Modi will hold bilateral discussions with President Anura Kumara Disanayake at the Presidential Secretariat and participate in a meeting between representatives of both nations.

Several Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) will be exchanged during the visit, covering key sectors such as energy, digitalisation, security and healthcare, along with agreements related to India’s debt restructuring assistance for Sri Lanka.
Prime Minister Modi will also virtually inaugurate several India-supported development projects, including the launch of the Sampur Solar Power Plant Project, the opening of a 5,000-metric-ton temperature and humidity-controlled cold storage facility in Dambulla and the installation of solar panels at 5,000 religious sites across Sri Lanka.

Additionally, he is scheduled to visit Anuradhapura to pay homage at the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi. He will also formally inaugurate the Maho-Anuradhapura railway signalling system and the newly upgraded Maho-Omanthai railway line, both of which were established with assistance from the Indian government.

Prime Minister Modi will conclude his official visit and depart from Sri Lanka on the afternoon of April 6.
