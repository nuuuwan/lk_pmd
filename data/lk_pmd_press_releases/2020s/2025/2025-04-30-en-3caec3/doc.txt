National Road Safety Plan under the “Clean Sri Lanka” Programme

A discussion on preparing a national-level road safety plan under the “Clean Sri Lanka” programme was held today (30) at the Presidential Secretariat.

The programme aims to uplift society by fostering social, environmental and moral consciousness. A central focus is placed on building a disciplined society and responsible citizens.

The discussion was attended by the senior officials representing the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, the National Council on Road Safety, the Independent Television Network (ITN), representatives from the Ministry of Health and Mass Media (Social and Ethics Divisions), Dr. Indika Jagoda, Director of the National Hospital (Accident and Emergency Department), Prof. Sivakumar and Prof. H.R. Pasidu from the University of Moratuwa, the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Traffic) and other relevant officials.
