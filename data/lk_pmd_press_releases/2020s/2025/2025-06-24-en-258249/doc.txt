Plans Afoot to Develop Nelumwewa Hot Springs Area in Welikanda to Promote Tourism
As part of the “Clean Sri Lanka” initiative, a development project has been proposed to enhance the area surrounding the Nelumwewa hot springs in Welikanda, Polonnaruwa, with the aim of promoting it as a tourist attraction.
A discussion regarding the proposed development was held this morning (24) at the site, followed by a field inspection.
Until now, the hot springs area has not been adequately developed, leading to a diminished interest from both local and international tourists.
During the discussion, attention was drawn to the importance of developing the Nelumwewa hot springs, the site’s tourism and scientific potential and its current condition.
Proposals currently being evaluated involve enhancing forest cover in the surrounding area, beautifying the island adjacent to the hot springs and building a bridge from the mainland to the island to facilitate better access for visitors.
Among those present were Deputy Minister of Housing T.B. Sarath, Chairman of the Welikanda Pradeshiya Sabha, D.W. Wasantha, retired hydrologist Prof. Dharma Gunawardena of the University of Peradeniya and officials from the Clean Sri Lanka Secretariat, the Mahaweli Authority, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, the Welikanda Divisional Secretariat and several other institutions.
