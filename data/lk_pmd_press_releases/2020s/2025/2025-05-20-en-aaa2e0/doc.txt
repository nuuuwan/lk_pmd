Presidential Secretariat Donates Vehicles to Support Rehabilitation of Disabled Veterans

In a gesture to bolster care for war-disabled soldiers, the Presidential Secretariat today (20) handed over five vehicles to the Ranaviru Seva Authority (RSA) for use in treatment and rehabilitation efforts. The handover ceremony, held at the President Secretariat Vehicle Yard, followed a request from the RSA to address logistical shortages at its nationwide facilities.

Under the directives of President Anura Kumara Disanayake, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake formally transferred ownership documents to the RSA at Sri Lanka Army Headquarters.  The donation was formally accepted on behalf of the RSA by Major Eranga Rathnayake.

The vehicles, two Mitsubishi Montero Jeeps, a Nissan Petrol Jeep, a Toyota Carina car and a Toyota Hilux, will be deployed to RSA rehabilitation centres in Anuradhapura, Kamburupitiya, Pangolla Abimansala, Attidiya Mihindu Seth Medura and Ragama Ranaviru Sevana. These centres provide residential care and medical support to veterans injured during service.
