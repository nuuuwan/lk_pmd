Discussion with Business Community Engaged in the ‘Dream Destination’ Project
A meeting with the group of business community supporting the implementation of the ‘Dream Destination’ project, which aims to modernize 100 railway stations across the country, was held yesterday (23) at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake.
During the discussion, Dr. Kumanayake emphasized the importance of collective national development and noted that the current government has established an open platform for anyone willing to contribute towards that goal.
He also extended his appreciation to the business community for voluntarily supporting the modernization of railway stations under the ‘Dream Destination’ initiative.
This project is a collaborative effort between the government, the private sector and the public to rebrand Sri Lanka’s railway stations with a modern identity that aligns with global standards.
The initiative is being carried out with the involvement of the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation, in collaboration with the ‘Clean Sri Lanka’ programme. With the support of the private sector, the project targets the transformation of 100 railway stations.
Its primary objective is to establish a clean and attractive railway station network that provides safety, accessibility and comfort to all passengers, including individuals with special needs.
Creative contributions for the project are being provided voluntarily by NIO Engineering, while funding for construction is being contributed by members of the business community. The construction work is expected to be completed within six months.
Senior Additional Secretary to the President, Mr. Kapila Janaka Bandara, Additional Secretary to the President, Mr. S.P.C. Sugeeshwara and several business leaders were also in attendance.
