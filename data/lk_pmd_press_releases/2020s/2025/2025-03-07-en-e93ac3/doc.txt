SLIC must enhance its contribution to the national economy  – President
President Anura Kumara Disanayake emphasised the necessity of transforming the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) into a significant contributor to the national economy through efficient and productive investments.
The President made these remarks during a discussion held today (07) at the Presidential Secretariat with officials of the SLIC.
The meeting included a comprehensive review of the corporation’s current operations. The President emphasized that any financial losses incurred by SLIC would directly impact the public who have invested in it. The President, therefore, stressed the need for comprehensive management practices to enhance profitability and ensure its sustainability as a state-owned enterprise.
The discussion was attended by SLIC Chairman Nusith Kumaratunga, members of the Board of Directors, and senior officials.
