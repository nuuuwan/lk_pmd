President Disanayake Meets IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath

President Anura Kumara Disanayake met with the Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Ms. Gita Gopinath, and the delegation this morning (16) at the Presidential Secretariat.

During the meeting, President Disanayake expressed his sincere appreciation to the IMF for its continued support in guiding Sri Lanka through its recent financial crisis. He also raised concerns regarding the recently imposed U.S. tariffs, noting their potential impact, as approximately 25% of Sri Lanka’s total exports are directed to the United States. The President further highlighted the challenges posed by on-going global conflicts and their potential implications for Sri Lanka. However, he mentioned to the delegation that appropriate measures are being taken to manage and mitigate these risks effectively.

The discussion also focused on Sri Lanka’s trade relationship with the European Union, particularly the GSP+ trade concession, which accounts for 23% of the country’s exports and provides preferential access to the EU market. The President emphasized the current government’s interest in expanding investment opportunities, stating that economic recovery would be driven through increased investor confidence. He reiterated that the current administration is people-oriented and committed to advancing in close alignment with public aspirations.

Ms. Gopinath thanked the President for the warm welcome and acknowledged the strong mandate he received in both the general and local elections, which she noted enhances the government’s ability to implement much-needed reforms. Reflecting on the country’s economic journey, she commended the remarkable progress achieved over the past two years from a state of severe crisis to renewed growth and falling inflation.

She also praised the strides made in governance reforms and emphasized the importance of sustaining and deepening these efforts. The IMF delegation reaffirmed its recognition of Sri Lanka’s substantial progress and pledged to remain a steadfast partner in the country’s reform and recovery process.

Also present at the meeting were Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Mr. Mahinda Siriwardana, Senior Economic Advisor to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa and Senior Additional Secretaries to the President Russell Aponsu.
