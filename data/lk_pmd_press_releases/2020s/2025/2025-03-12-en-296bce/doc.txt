JICA and JFTC Support Sri Lanka’s Drive for Economic Growth through a Fair and Competitive Market

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) have expressed their support for policy reforms and institutional enhancements aimed at ensuring the supply of high-quality goods and services in Sri Lanka while safeguarding both consumers and producers.

This was discussed at a meeting held today (12) at the Presidential Secretariat with representatives of these organisations and the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake.

During the discussion, the representatives emphasized that establishing fairness in trade would protect both consumers and producers while fostering a competitive market in the country.

They also emphasized how Japan’s competitive trade policies contributed to its economic progress, explaining that such policies not only help to protect consumer rights but also stimulate innovation.

Secretary to the President noted that this year’s budget has placed special emphasis on the required policy adjustments to promote fair trade while elevating Sri Lanka’s market to a higher level. He also briefed the representatives on these planned reforms.

The meeting was attended by Senior Additional Secretary to the President, Russell Aponsu, JICA representatives Tetsuya Yamada, Arisa Inada, Yuri Horrita, and Namal Ralapanawa; and JFTC representatives Y. Sakuma, Y. Asahina, Y. Fukushima, and M. Takeuchi.
