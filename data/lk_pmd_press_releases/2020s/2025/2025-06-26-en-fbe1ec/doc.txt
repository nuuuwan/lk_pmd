NIRDC Engages in Discussions with Leading International Agencies to Enhance Youth Entrepreneurship in Research and Development.

The National Initiative for Research and Development Commercialization (NIRDC) recently engaged in separate high-level meetings with leading international agencies to strengthen Sri Lanka’s research, development, and innovation sectors. As part of this effort, NIRDC held individual discussions with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 20 June 2025 and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on 24 June 2025.

These meetings emphasized the importance of empowering youth as the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders, particularly by supporting start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the fields of science, technology, and research. The aim is to help these ventures grow into sustainable and stable businesses.

Aligned with Sri Lanka’s new Research and Development (R&D) Policy, these ongoing discussions aim to build strategic partnerships that position the country as a regional hub for science-driven entrepreneurship.

NIRDC remains committed to fostering an innovation-based economy through youth leadership and international collaboration.

The ADB meeting was attended by Mr. Takafumi Kadono, ADB’s Sri Lanka Resident Representative; Professor Lerwen Liu from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; and Mr. Rajendra Mootha, Head of New Initiatives at IITM Pravartak Technologies Foundation. The JICA meeting included Mr. Kuronuma Kenji, Chief Representative, and Ms. Ide Yuri, Senior Representative of JICA. Representing NIRDC at both meetings were Professor Gomika Udugamasooriya, Presidential Senior Advisor on Science and Technology and Founder of NIRDC; Dr. Muditha D. Senarath Yapa, Director General; and Mr. Indunil Gunathilake, Director (Investments).
