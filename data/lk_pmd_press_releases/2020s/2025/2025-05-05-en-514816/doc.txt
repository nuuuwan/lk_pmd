Vietnamese President Luong Cuong warmly welcomed President Anura Kumara Disanayake during an official ceremony held in Hanoi this morning (05), marking the commencement of a state visit from May 4–6.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was accorded a ceremonial welcome with full military honours upon his arrival at the Presidential Palace of Vietnam this morning (05). He also took part in the inspection of the Tri-Forces Guard of Honour and the playing of the national anthems of Vietnam and Sri Lanka. The two leaders then introduced members of their respective high-level delegations before proceeding to bilateral discussions.
Subsequently, discussions between Sri Lanka and Vietnam began, during which both nations assessed their progress, explored avenues for future collaboration and signed Memoranda of Understanding.
This visit aims to strengthen political trust and foster effective collaboration across multiple sectors between the two nations.
Vietnam and Sri Lanka have upheld robust and enduring ties since they established diplomatic relations in 1970.
Sri Lanka and Vietnam engage in annual bilateral trade, primarily in exports, totalling around US$200 million. Both nations aspire to elevate this trade to US$1 billion in the near future.
As Vietnam and Sri Lanka commemorate the 55th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries this year, both nations are poised to enhance their relationship by building on mutual trust and common development objectives.
President Dissanayake’s visit highlights Sri Lanka’s deep commitment to its longstanding friendship with Vietnam and demonstrates a mutual resolve to enhance collaboration in traditional sectors while exploring new opportunities in digital transformation, the digital economy, energy transition, artificial intelligence and connectivity.
